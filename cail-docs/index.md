# CUNY AI Lab Sandbox Documentation

The Sandbox is an AI platform built for teaching and research at CUNY. It runs on CUNY infrastructure, keeps student data private, and gives you full control over how AI tools work in your courses.

This documentation is organized into three kits. Start with whichever matches where you are right now.

## Starter Kit

**For:** First-time users who need to log in and get oriented.

- [Getting Started](starter-kit/getting-started.md) — Log in, have your first conversation, explore the interface.

## Design Kit

**For:** Instructors and researchers ready to build custom AI configurations.

- [Models](design-kit/models.md) — Create AI agents with specific behaviors and knowledge.
- [System Prompts](design-kit/system-prompts.md) — Six prompt patterns for teaching: Socratic questioning, writing coaching, responsive tutoring, guardrails, and more.
- [Knowledge Bases](design-kit/knowledge-bases.md) — Upload your documents. Ground AI responses in your materials.

## About the Sandbox

The CUNY AI Lab Sandbox runs [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com), an open-source AI platform. It connects to commercial models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini) and locally hosted open-source models through a unified interface. All data stays on CUNY-managed infrastructure.

The platform is maintained by the [CUNY AI Lab](https://ailab.gc.cuny.edu) at the Graduate Center.

**Questions?** Contact the AI Lab team or visit the [Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit](https://aitoolkit.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) for additional pedagogical resources.
