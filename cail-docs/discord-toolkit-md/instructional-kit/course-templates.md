Tired of reinventing the wheel? Try adopting a server template modeled by another educator. See below for two template collections to choose from: the **course collection** offers server templates designed expressly for teaching purposes: the **community collection**

Each template can be accessed with the associated hyperlink. In order to create a template lick the link to left in the submission number to the left of each course title, you will be redirected to a Discord browser where you will then be prompted to create a new server based on the submitted server on which that template is modeled. Once you clone your template, you can tailor its layout and design to your specific instructional needs.
