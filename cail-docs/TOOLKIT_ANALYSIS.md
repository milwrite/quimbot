---

## Executive Summary

Both the Discord Educational Toolkit and the Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit demonstrate exceptional instructional design for faculty-facing documentation. They share a common voice, structure, and approach to progressive disclosure that makes complex platforms accessible to instructors who are also platform users.

This analysis examines their prose style, level of detail, multimedia integration, and pedagogical approach — with the goal of extracting principles for calibrating the CAIL documentation.

## 1. Structure & Organization

### Three-Kit Model (Discord Toolkit)

The Discord toolkit uses a modular structure with three progressive kits:

1. **Starter Kit** (3 pages)
   - Server Setup
   - Student Onboarding
   - Initial configuration

2. **Design Kit** (5 pages)
   - Server Design
   - Server Customization
   - Role Management
   - Server Models

3. **Instructional Kit** (6 pages)
   - Course Design
   - Course Announcements
   - Class Discussion
   - Group Collaboration
   - Course Templates
   - Template Collection

**Key Principle:** Progressive disclosure through staged learning paths — users can stop at any kit level depending on their needs.

### Topical Sections (AI Toolkit)

The AI toolkit uses a more traditional topic-based organization:

- **Provocations** (Critical questions to pose to students)
- **About AI** (Conceptual overview)
- **Course Policy** (Guidelines and syllabus language)
- **Assignment Makeovers** (Redesign strategies)
- **Sample Activities** (Reusable learning activities)
- **Resource Hub** (Links, references, tools)

**Key Principle:** Each section is self-contained and reusable — instructors can jump to what they need without sequential reading.

---

## 2. Voice & Prose Style

### Characteristics

Both toolkits share a distinctive voice:

- **Direct address to instructors** ("you," "your students")
- **Collegial, supportive tone** (not bureaucratic or technical)
- **Actionable, concrete language** (minimal abstraction)
- **Contextual framing** ("Clarity is paramount when..." / "Students should understand that...")
- **Anticipates instructor concerns** (addresses "why" before "how")

### Example Comparisons

**Discord Toolkit (Server Setup):**
> "After you open the app and sign in, Discord will prompt you to set up your first server. Here's how:"

**AI Toolkit (Assignment Makeovers):**
> "The mainstreaming and commercialization of generative AI tools has made it difficult to overstate the value of well-crafted assignment design."

**Common Elements:**
- Clear topic sentences that frame context
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Bulleted lists for procedures and concepts
- Transitional guidance between sections

### Rhetorical Moves

1. **Contextual framing** → Why this matters
2. **Procedural guidance** → How to do it
3. **Feature elaboration** → What this enables
4. **Examples and scenarios** → Real-world application
5. **Reflective questions** → Critical engagement

---

## 3. Level of Detail & Granularity

### Procedural Depth

**Discord Toolkit** uses numbered step-by-step instructions with visual support:

```markdown
1. Click **Create My Own**
2. Click **For me and my friends**
   - This option means you intend to create a private server...
3. Give your server a name, then upload an image as its icon
   - Name: I recommend your course title and subtitle...
   - Image: I suggest using your college/university logo...
4. Click **Create**
```

**Key Principle:** Every click is documented. Sub-bullets provide rationale and recommendations.

### Conceptual Depth

**AI Toolkit** balances conceptual explanation with practical application:

- **Provocations section:** High-level critical questions
- **Assignment Makeovers:** Methodological frameworks (6-question framework from Derek Bruff)
- **Sample Activities:** Detailed learning objectives + suggested tools

**Key Principle:** Scaffolds from theory to practice — conceptual grounding before procedural steps.

---

## 4. Use of Multimedia & Visual Figures

### Discord Toolkit

- **GIFs** for demonstrating UI interactions (animated walkthroughs)
- **Screenshots** for static reference points
- **Embedded videos** (implied, through external links)
- **Visual annotations** on images

Example from Server Setup:
```markdown
![how to create a server](https://media.giphy.com/media/vXMaFHoTGKkvsXDVOM/giphy.gif)
```

### AI Toolkit

- **Fewer images** (more text-heavy by nature of the subject)
- **Embedded documents** (Google Docs, external resources)
- **Links to external tools** and references
- **Blockquotes** for key passages from sources

**Key Principle:** Visual support is contextual — UI docs need more visuals; conceptual docs rely on clear prose and external links.

---

## 5. Progressive Disclosure Principles

### Information Layering

Both toolkits demonstrate progressive disclosure through:

1. **Overview pages** → Brief introduction to section
2. **Detailed sub-pages** → Deep dives on specific features/topics
3. **External resources** → Links for advanced learners
4. **"Further Reading" sections** → Optional depth

### Example: Student Onboarding (Discord)

**Layer 1:** Overview of server invite links  
**Layer 2:** Step-by-step invite link creation  
**Layer 3:** Onboarding materials guidance  
**Layer 4:** Welcome message example with full text  
**Layer 5:** Embedded external doc from Sarah Madoka Currie

### Example: Assignment Makeovers (AI)

**Layer 1:** "Back to Basics" conceptual framing  
**Layer 2:** Derek Bruff's 6-question framework  
**Layer 3:** Scaffolding learning (with quote from Teach@CUNY Handbook)  
**Layer 4:** Activity inventories and stress testing  
**Layer 5:** External workshop PDF from Laquintano & Vee

**Key Principle:** Each layer is optional — readers can stop when they have what they need.

---

## 6. Instructional Design Patterns

### Pattern: Model Uses + Feature Suggestions

**Example from Class Discussion (Discord):**

```markdown
## Model Uses
- **Backchannel Communication**: [description]
- **Assign Helpers or Scribes**: [description]
- **Free Writes**: [description]
- **Q/A Space**: [description]

## Feature Suggestions
- **Events**: [step-by-step procedure]
- **Threads**: [step-by-step procedure]
```

**Key Principle:** Separate pedagogical rationale (Model Uses) from technical implementation (Feature Suggestions).

### Pattern: Provocations → Framework → Activities

**Example from AI Toolkit:**

1. **Provocations** (critical questions)
2. **Conceptual Framework** (Derek Bruff, scaffolding theory)
3. **Sample Activities** (concrete reusable exercises)

**Key Principle:** Move from critical thinking to actionable practice.

---

## 7. Authorship & Attribution

Both toolkits practice generous attribution:

- **Direct quotes** from scholars (Derek Bruff, John Warner, etc.)
- **Links to external resources** (workshops, guides, tools)
- **Credit to community contributors** (Sarah Madoka Currie)
- **Institutional grounding** (CUNY context, Teach@CUNY Handbook)

**Key Principle:** Documentation is a community practice — cite sources, share credit, invite participation.

---

## 8. Navigation & Wayfinding

### Cross-Linking

Both toolkits use consistent footer navigation:

```markdown
[← Return to Previous Page]     [Continue to Next Page →]
```

### Internal References

- **Bold keywords** for emphasis
- **Inline links** to related concepts
- **Section headers** as visual anchors
- **Bulleted lists** for scannability

---

## 9. Accessibility & Inclusive Design

### Language Accessibility

- **Plain language** (minimal jargon)
- **Defined terms** (glossary in AI toolkit)
- **Cultural sensitivity** (CUNY student diversity acknowledged)
- **Multiple pathways** (text + visual + procedural)

### Example: AI Toolkit "Visualizing Student Perspectives"

> "It helps to keep learner perspectives in mind when remaking assignments that accommodate tools like ChatGPT, given the diverse life circumstances of CUNY students."

**Key Principle:** Documentation should acknowledge the lived reality of users.

---

## 10. Application to CAIL Docs

### Recommended Calibrations

#### 1. **Adopt Three-Kit Structure**

CAIL could benefit from a similar progressive disclosure model:

- **Starter Kit:** Getting Started with CAIL
- **Design Kit:** Customizing CAIL for Your Course
- **Instructional Kit:** Pedagogical Patterns & Activities

#### 2. **Voice Refinement**

- Shift from technical documentation → instructor-facing guidance
- Address "you" directly
- Provide rationale alongside procedures
- Anticipate instructor questions and concerns

#### 3. **Granularity Calibration**

- **High granularity for UI procedures** (every click documented)
- **Conceptual depth for pedagogical patterns** (why this matters)
- **Optional layers** (basic → advanced → external resources)

#### 4. **Multimedia Strategy**

- **GIFs for workflows** (animated walkthroughs)
- **Screenshots for reference** (annotated where helpful)
- **Embedded examples** (student work, templates)
- **External links** (research, tools, communities)

#### 5. **Progressive Disclosure**

Each doc should layer information:

1. **Overview** (what this is, why it matters)
2. **Quick Start** (minimum viable steps)
3. **Deep Dive** (detailed procedures)
4. **Advanced** (customization, edge cases)
5. **Further Reading** (external resources)

#### 6. **Pedagogical Framing**

Separate "what the system does" from "why an instructor would use this":

- **Feature Description:** [Technical capability]
- **Instructional Use Case:** [Pedagogical scenario]
- **Step-by-Step Guide:** [Procedural implementation]

---

## 11. Style Guide Principles (Extracted)

### Prose

- **Sentence length:** Vary. Mix short declaratives with longer explanatory sentences.
- **Paragraph length:** 2-4 sentences average. Break up dense text.
- **Transitions:** Use transitional phrases to connect ideas ("In turn," "Toward that end," "Here it is key").
- **Active voice:** Prefer active constructions ("Instructors should..." not "It is recommended that...").

### Formatting

- **Bold for emphasis:** Use sparingly for key terms and actions.
- **Italics for questions and provocations:** Distinguishes reflective prompts.
- **Bulleted lists for concepts:** Numbered lists for procedures.
- **Headers as signposts:** Clear, descriptive section titles.

### Tone

- **Collegial:** Peer-to-peer, not top-down.
- **Supportive:** "Here's how" not "You should already know."
- **Contextual:** Always explain why before how.
- **Realistic:** Acknowledge complexity and constraints.

---

## 12. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review existing CAIL docs** against these principles
2. **Identify gaps** (missing progressive disclosure, unclear voice, insufficient granularity)
3. **Create style guide** based on toolkit exemplars
4. **Develop template structure** for CAIL doc pages
5. **Pilot rewrite** of 2-3 existing docs using new framework

### Collaborative Calibration

- **Petrarch + Quimbot:** Develop CAIL-specific style guide skill
- **Apply exemplar patterns** to existing CAIL documentation
- **Test with instructors** (if possible) for usability feedback
- **Iterate** based on real-world use

## Conclusion

Both toolkits demonstrate excellence in instructor-facing documentation:

- **Voice:** Collegial, supportive, contextual
- **Structure:** Progressive disclosure through modular organization
- **Detail:** High granularity for procedures, conceptual depth for pedagogy
- **Multimedia:** Contextual — visuals where helpful, clear prose otherwise
- **Accessibility:** Plain language, multiple pathways, inclusive framing

These principles are directly applicable to CAIL documentation and can inform the development of a calibration skill for refining CAIL docs to match this level of clarity, usability, and pedagogical sophistication.
