# Voice Calibration: Before & After

These transformations show how to shift from technical documentation voice to the collegial instructor-facing voice used in the Discord Educational Toolkit and Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit.

## Example 1: Feature Introduction

**Before (technical):**
> Knowledge Collections enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — a technique that combines language models with retrieved knowledge from external sources to enhance response quality and accuracy.

**After (calibrated):**
> When you build a Knowledge Collection, you give the AI access to your own documents. Instead of drawing on its general training data (which may be outdated or wrong), the model searches your uploads for relevant passages before responding. The result is a conversation grounded in what you have actually assigned, written, or approved.

**What changed:** Jargon defined through function, not acronym. Passive technical framing replaced with direct address and practical consequence.

## Example 2: Procedural Step

**Before (technical):**
> Navigate to Workspace → Models → + New Model. Select a base model from the dropdown. Configure the system prompt. Save.

**After (calibrated):**
> 1. Click **Workspace** in the left sidebar
> 2. Select **Models**
> 3. Click **+ New Model**
>    - This opens the model editor. You will define the model's behavior, attach documents, and choose which tools it can use.
> 4. Choose a base model from the dropdown
>    - The available models depend on which providers your Sandbox is connected to. If you do not see the model you need, contact the AI Lab team.
> 5. Write a system prompt that tells the model how to behave
> 6. Click **Save**

**What changed:** Every click is a numbered step. Sub-bullets explain what happens and why. Anticipates the reader's questions.

## Example 3: Best Practice

**Before (technical):**
> It is recommended that system prompts reflect institutional values and academic integrity standards.

**After (calibrated):**
> Craft system prompts that reflect your course values. If you want the model to encourage process over product, say so directly: "Do not write complete essays for students. Instead, ask follow-up questions that help them develop their own arguments." Explicit constraints help both the model and your students understand the boundaries of appropriate use.

**What changed:** Passive voice eliminated. Abstract recommendation replaced with concrete example. Addresses the instructor directly.

## Example 4: Contextual Framing

**Before (technical):**
> Open WebUI supports shared workspaces for collaborative model development.

**After (calibrated):**
> You do not have to build everything from scratch. Open WebUI lets you share models, knowledge bases, and prompt libraries across your department. A colleague who built a strong writing tutor model can share it with you. You can adapt it to your sections without starting over.

**What changed:** Feature description reframed as practical benefit. "Shared workspaces" translated into what it actually means for an instructor's workload.

## Example 5: Opening a Section

**Before (technical):**
> Tools extend what models can do beyond text generation. They connect models to external services, databases, APIs, and computational functions.

**After (calibrated):**
> Out of the box, a model can only generate text. Tools change that. With tools enabled, a model can search the web for current information, run Python code, query academic databases, or generate images. Think of tools as the difference between a colleague who can talk about research and one who can also pull up the actual papers.

**What changed:** Abstract capability list replaced with concrete analogy. Opens with the limitation that tools solve, then shows the payoff.

## Transition Phrases (from toolkits)

Use these to connect ideas naturally:

- "In turn," (AI Toolkit, used frequently)
- "Toward that end,"
- "Here it is key for instructors to..."
- "With a little practice, though, the task grows easier"
- "Pick and choose what suits you best"
- "Before proceeding, instructors should..."
- "Keep it up and you'll be..."
- "This brings together the affordances of..."
- "This module walks you through..."
- "Bulleted below are..."

## Rhetorical Moves (sequence)

1. **Why this matters** (contextual framing)
2. **What it does** (feature in plain terms)
3. **How to do it** (numbered steps)
4. **What it enables** (teaching scenarios)
5. **What to watch for** (caveats, tips)
6. **Where to go deeper** (external resources)
