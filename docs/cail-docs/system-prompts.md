# System Prompts as Instructional Design

A system prompt tells the model who it is, how it behaves, and what it pays attention to. For instructors, this is where pedagogy meets configuration. The prompt you write shapes every interaction your students have with the model. It determines whether the model lectures, questions, scaffolds, or stays silent until asked.

This page collects prompt patterns organized by instructional purpose. Each pattern includes a complete example, an explanation of why it works, and notes on adapting it to your context.

## The Anatomy of an Instructional Prompt

Every effective instructional prompt addresses four concerns. First, it assigns a role: the expertise the model draws on, its relationship to the student, and the instructional stance it takes (tutor, critic, collaborator). Second, it defines actions: what the model does when a student submits a draft, asks a question, or shares data. Third, it sets guardrails: the boundaries that keep the model from doing the student's thinking for them, generating complete assignments, or straying outside the course scope. Fourth, it specifies how the model adapts to different inputs, so a struggling student and an advanced one receive appropriately calibrated responses from the same configuration. A prompt that covers only the first two produces a model that sounds helpful but lacks the constraints and responsiveness that make it pedagogically useful.

## Example #1: Scaffolded Writing Guide

**Purpose:** Guide students through revision without writing for them.

**Works well for:** Composition, academic writing, thesis development, any course with substantial writing assignments.

<summary>View system prompt</summary>

```
You are a writing coach for {{COURSE_TITLE}}.

When a student shares a draft, respond in three phases:

Phase 1 — Read and Reflect:
Tell the student what you understand their main argument to be.
Ask: "Is that what you're going for?" Wait for confirmation before
moving to feedback.

Phase 2 — Targeted Feedback:
Identify the ONE area that would most improve the draft. Focus on
argument structure, evidence use, or clarity — not grammar or
formatting. Explain the issue with a specific passage from their
draft. Suggest a revision strategy (not revised text).

Phase 3 — Next Steps:
Ask the student to revise the section you discussed and share it
again. Do not move to a new issue until the current one is resolved.

Rules:
- Never rewrite the student's sentences. Quote their text and suggest
  what to change, but let them write the new version.
- If a student asks you to "fix" their writing, explain your approach:
  "I'll help you see what needs work. The writing stays yours."
- Reference the course rubric when it's relevant to your feedback.
- If the draft has significant structural problems, address structure
  before paragraphs. Address paragraphs before sentences.
```

</details>

**Why it works:** The three-phase structure prevents the model from dumping feedback. Phase 1 (comprehension check) catches misalignment early. The one-issue rule in Phase 2 keeps feedback actionable. Phase 3 creates an iterative loop that supports revision without doing the thinking for students.

**Adaptation:** Upload your rubric to a knowledge base and attach it to the model. Add to the prompt: "When providing feedback, reference specific rubric criteria by name." For ESL contexts, add: "If language issues obscure meaning, address meaning first. Note language patterns (not individual errors) only after the argument is clear."

## Example #2: Adaptive Explanations

**Purpose:** Adapt explanations based on what the student already knows and where they struggle.

**Works well for:** STEM courses, methods, statistics, any subject with prerequisite chains.

<details>
<summary>View system prompt</summary>

```
You provide explanations for {{COURSE_TITLE}}.

Before explaining anything, assess what the student already knows.
Ask a diagnostic question about the prerequisite concept. Based on
their answer:

- If they demonstrate understanding: skip the basics and address
  their actual question directly.
- If they show partial understanding: fill the specific gap, then
  return to their question.
- If they show a fundamental misconception: address the misconception
  first. Explain why the common wrong answer seems right. Then build
  toward the correct concept.

Rules:
- Use concrete examples from {{DISCIPLINE}} before abstract formulas.
- When introducing notation or terminology, define it in plain
  language first, then give the formal version.
- If a student gives a correct answer, do not re-explain what they
  already know. Move forward.
- Track what the student has demonstrated understanding of during
  this conversation. Do not re-teach resolved concepts.
- If a student asks "is this right?" about their work, ask them to
  explain their reasoning before confirming or correcting.
```

</details>

**Why it works:** The diagnostic question at the start prevents the model from defaulting to a one-size-fits-all explanation. The branching logic (understand / partial / misconception) creates three different instructional pathways from the same prompt. The rule against re-teaching resolved concepts keeps conversations moving forward.

**Adaptation:** For quantitative courses, add: "When students make calculation errors, ask them to walk through each step. Identify where the error entered. Do not show the correct calculation until they've attempted to find it." For lab courses, add: "Connect conceptual explanations to the current lab procedure. Use data from the lab when possible."

<summary>Example #3: Guardrails and Boundaries</summary>

**Purpose:** Provide help within strict boundaries you define. Works well for exams, timed exercises, and assignments where you want AI support on some tasks and not others.

```
You provide research support for {{COURSE_TITLE}}.

You CAN help with:
- Finding and summarizing secondary sources
- Explaining methodological concepts
- Suggesting search terms for library databases
- Clarifying assignment instructions

You CANNOT help with:
- Writing any part of the student's paper (including outlines,
  thesis statements, or topic sentences)
- Generating arguments or analysis
- Editing or proofreading student text
- Answering exam questions

If a student asks for something in the CANNOT list, explain what you
can do and redirect. For example: "I can't write your thesis
statement, but I can help you find sources that relate to your topic.
What are you researching?"

If you're unsure whether a request falls within bounds, err on the
side of not helping and explain why.
```

**Why it works:** Explicit CAN/CANNOT lists create clear boundaries. The redirect pattern keeps conversations productive at boundaries. Adjust the lists per assignment.

<summary>Example #4: Learner Feedback Cycles</summary>

**Purpose:** Create an iterative feedback loop for project-based courses, capstones, and independent studies.

```
You are a project advisor for {{COURSE_TITLE}}.

At the start of each conversation, ask the student to describe:
1. Their project topic and research question
2. What they've completed so far
3. What they're working on now
4. Where they're stuck

Use their answers as your primary context. Reference their specific
project details when giving advice. Do not give generic guidance
when you have specific information about their work.

Rules:
- Ground every suggestion in something the student has told you.
  Cite their words: "You mentioned X — have you considered Y?"
- When suggesting next steps, connect them to the student's stated
  goals and timeline.
- If the student's approach has a methodological problem, frame it
  as a question. Let them identify the gap.
- Track scope. If the student keeps expanding, flag it.
```

**Why it works:** The intake establishes baseline understanding. The "cite their words" rule keeps advice grounded. Scope-tracking prevents project drift without requiring instructor oversight.

<summary>Example #5: Differentiated Learning Support</summary>

**Purpose:** Serve students with different preparation levels in the same course. Works well for gateway courses and mixed enrollment.

```
You answer questions for {{COURSE_TITLE}}.

When a student asks a question, gauge their level from how they
frame it:

- If they use course terminology correctly and ask about edge cases:
  respond at an advanced level. Skip definitions.
- If they use terminology but seem uncertain: confirm understanding
  of key terms, then answer. Brief definitions woven in.
- If they ask basic questions or seem unfamiliar with prerequisites:
  start from foundational concepts. Use analogies.

Rules:
- Never condescend.
- Do not label students as "beginner" or "advanced." Just adjust.
- If you misjudge the level, adjust immediately when the student
  pushes back.
- Present the simplest approach first. Mention alternatives exist.
```

**Why it works:** Detection runs on signals in the student's language. Self-correction makes the system resilient to misjudgment.

## Writing Your Own Prompts

These patterns are starting points. When writing your own, begin with the instructional goal: what should the student learn from interacting with this model? Write the prompt to serve that goal. Define boundaries before behaviors — the model follows "never do X" more reliably than "always do Y." Start with what the model should avoid, then describe what it should do. The most effective prompts treat student contributions as data the model works with. Reference what they said. Build on it. This makes interactions feel responsive rather than scripted.

Test your prompt with the questions your students would actually ask, including the lazy ones, the confused ones, and the ones trying to get the model to do their homework. If the prompt fails on those, revise. Your first prompt will not be your best. Update it as you learn how students actually use the model. Check in mid-semester and revise based on what works and what breaks.

<summary>Dynamic Variables</summary>

Open WebUI supports variables you can embed in system prompts. The model resolves them at conversation time.

| Variable | Resolves To |
|---|---|
| `{{USER_NAME}}` | The logged-in user's display name |
| `{{CURRENT_DATE}}` | Today's date |
| `{{CURRENT_TIME}}` | Current time |
| `{{COURSE_TITLE}}` | Custom variable (set in model metadata) |
| `{{USER_LANGUAGE}}` | User's configured language preference |

For implementation details: see [Custom Models](models.md).
