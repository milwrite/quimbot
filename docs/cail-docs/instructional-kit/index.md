# Instructional Kit

You have built a model, loaded your course materials, and configured permissions. Now the question shifts: how do you teach with this?

The Instructional Kit covers the pedagogical side of AI integration. How to design activities that use AI productively. How to onboard students so they get value from day one. How to structure assignments that develop critical thinking about AI outputs.

These pages draw on patterns from CUNY instructors who have integrated AI tools into their courses across disciplines. Each page includes concrete examples you can adapt to your own teaching context.

## What's in the Instructional Kit

- **[Pedagogical Patterns](pedagogical-patterns.md)** — Strategies for integrating AI into your teaching: scaffolded inquiry, structured critique, collaborative analysis, iterative revision.
- **[Sample Activities](sample-activities.md)** — Ready-to-use exercises with model configurations. Copy, adapt, assign.
- **[Student Onboarding](student-onboarding.md)** — A first-week plan for introducing AI tools to your students, including discussion prompts and skill-building exercises.
- **[Use Cases](use-cases.md)** — Detailed workflows showing how instructors across disciplines use the Sandbox throughout a semester.

## How to Use This Kit

Start wherever your need is most immediate. If you already know what you want to teach with AI, jump to Sample Activities. If you want to think through the pedagogical rationale first, start with Pedagogical Patterns. If your semester starts next week and you need to get students set up, go straight to Student Onboarding.
