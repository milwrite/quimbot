# CUNY AI Lab Sandbox Documentation

The CUNY AI Lab Sandbox is an AI platform for teaching and research at CUNY. It runs on CUNY infrastructure, keeps student data private, and gives you full control over how AI tools work in your courses and projects.

This toolkit guides you through three module sequences: getting oriented, building custom AI configurations, and designing instruction around them.

## Starter Kit

Your first session with the Sandbox. Log in, explore the interface, and get comfortable.

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
