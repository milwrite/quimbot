# CUNY CAIL Sandbox Documentation

The CUNY CAIL Sandbox is an AI platform for teaching and research at CUNY. It runs on CUNY infrastructure, keeps student data private, and gives you full control over how AI tools work in your courses and projects.

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) — Log in, explore the interface, have your first conversation.
- [Sandbox Basics](sandbox-basics.md) — Terminology, interface layout, and navigation.

## Design & Test

- [Custom Models](models.md) — Build custom AI configurations for your courses, including [system prompts](system-prompts.md) that shape how models interact with students.
- [Knowledge Bases](knowledge-bases.md) — Upload your documents so models can reference them.
- [Tools & Skills](tools-skills.md) — Add web search, code execution, and domain expertise.
- [Roles & Permissions](roles-permissions.md) — Control who can access what.

## Teach & Refine

- [Teaching Tips](teaching-tips.md) — Strategies for integrating AI into your courses.
- [Sample Activities](sample-activities.md) — Ready-to-use exercises with model configurations.
- [Student Onboarding](student-onboarding.md) — A first-week plan for introducing AI tools.
- [Use Cases](use-cases.md) — Semester-long workflows across disciplines.

## About the Sandbox

The CUNY CAIL Sandbox is hosted and maintained by the [CUNY AI Lab](https://ailab.gc.cuny.edu) at the Graduate Center. It runs [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com), an open-source platform configured for academic use at CUNY.

**Models:** The Sandbox hosts open-weight models selected for teaching and research. See the [Model Registry](https://ailab.gc.cuny.edu/models/) for the current list.

**Support:** Questions, workshop schedules, and office hours are available through the [AI Lab website](https://ailab.gc.cuny.edu).

**Teaching Resources:** Visit the [Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit](https://aitoolkit.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) for pedagogical guidance on integrating AI into your courses.
