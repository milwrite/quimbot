## About the Sandbox

The CUNY AI Lab Sandbox is hosted and maintained by the [CUNY AI Lab](https://ailab.gc.cuny.edu) at the Graduate Center. It runs [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com), an open-source platform configured for academic use at CUNY.

**Models:** The Sandbox hosts open-weight models selected for teaching and research. See the [Model Registry](https://ailab.gc.cuny.edu/models/) for the current list.

**Support:** Questions, workshop schedules, and office hours are available through the [AI Lab website](https://ailab.gc.cuny.edu).

**Teaching Resources:** Visit the [Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit](https://aitoolkit.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) for pedagogical guidance on integrating AI into your courses.
