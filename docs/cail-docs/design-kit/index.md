# Design Kit

You have logged in, chatted with a model, and explored the interface. Now it is time to build. The Design Kit covers the workspace features that let you create custom AI configurations for your courses, research, and administrative work.

Each page in this kit follows the same structure: why the feature matters, how instructors use it, step-by-step setup, and advanced options for those who want more control. Start with whichever page addresses your most pressing need.

## What's in the Design Kit

- **[Models](models.md)** — Create custom AI agents with specific behaviors, knowledge, and tools. Define system prompts, attach documents, set parameters.
- **[System Prompts](system-prompts.md)** — Six prompt patterns for instructional design: Socratic questioning, scaffolded writing coaching, responsive tutoring, guardrails, student-input learning, and differentiated instruction.
- **[Knowledge Bases](knowledge-bases.md)** — Upload your course materials and institutional documents. Ground AI responses in your data.
- **[Tools & Skills](tools-skills.md)** — Extend what models can do: web search, code execution, academic database access, and domain-specific knowledge.
- **[Roles & Permissions](roles-permissions.md)** — Control who can access what. Set up groups for courses, departments, or research teams.

## How the Pieces Fit Together

A custom model is an assembly of these components. You pick a base AI model, write a system prompt that defines its behavior, attach knowledge bases that ground it in your documents, bind tools that extend its capabilities, and set permissions that control who can use it. Each component is independent: you can build a knowledge base without creating a custom model, or bind tools to an existing model without starting from scratch.

The pages in this kit can be read in any order, but if you are building your first custom configuration, start with Models and work through sequentially.
