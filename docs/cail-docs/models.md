# Custom Models

A custom model lets you shape how the AI behaves in your course, what documents it draws from, and which tools it can use. You are not training a new AI from scratch. You are assembling existing components into something tuned to your teaching context: what the AI should do, what it should refuse to do, and what materials it should draw from when responding.

## Creating a Model

Here's how to build a custom model:

1. Click **Workspace** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Models**
3. Click **+ New Model**
   - This opens the model editor. You will define the model's behavior, connect it to your documents, and choose which tools it can access.
4. Choose a **base model** from the dropdown
   - The available models depend on which providers your Sandbox is connected to. If you need a specific model and do not see it listed, contact the CAIL team.
5. Write a **system prompt** (see below for guidance)
6. Attach **knowledge bases** if you want the model to draw from your documents
   - See [Knowledge Bases](knowledge-bases.md) for how to create one
7. Bind **tools** if you want the model to search the web, run code, or access other services
   - See [Tools & Skills](tools-skills.md) for available options
8. Add **prompt suggestions**
   - These appear as clickable chips above the input bar when students open a new chat. They show users what the model can do and how to talk to it.
9. Set **visibility**
   - **Private**: only you can use it
   - **Limited**: shared with specific users or groups (e.g., your course section)
   - **Public**: available to all Sandbox users
10. Click **Save**

## System Prompt

The system prompt defines how the model behaves: its role, boundaries, and instructional approach. Write it in step 5 above. For patterns, examples, and advanced prompt techniques, see [System Prompts as Instructional Design](system-prompts.md).

### Prompt Suggestions

Prompt suggestions are clickable chips that appear when a user opens a fresh chat. They show students what the model can do. Examples for a data analysis model:

- "What visualization works best for this data?"
- "Help me interpret these statistical results"
- "Which test should I use for this research question?"

### Advanced Parameters

Most instructors will not need to adjust these. They control how the model generates responses.

- **Max Tokens** sets response length. One token is roughly three-quarters of a word. Lower values (100-500) produce concise answers. Higher values (1000-4000) allow detailed explanations. Increase if responses cut off mid-sentence.
- **Temperature** controls randomness. Lower values (0.1 to 0.3) produce focused, deterministic responses. Higher values (0.7 to 1.0) allow more creative variation.
- **Top P** (nucleus sampling) controls diversity of word selection. Leave at default unless you have a specific reason to change it.
- **Stop Sequences** force the model to stop generating when it encounters specific text strings. Enter sequences like `<|end_of_text|>` or `User:` and press Enter.

### Switching Models Mid-Chat

You can change models during a conversation by clicking the model name at the top of the chat. The conversation context carries across the switch. This lets you use different models for different stages of a task.

> **Tip:** Encourage students to experiment with model switching. Different models have different strengths.

## Callout

<div class="callout">
  <strong>For instructors:</strong> When building models for your courses, make your expectations for AI use explicit in the system prompt. If the model should refuse to generate complete assignments, encode that boundary. If it should encourage process over product, say so directly. Students benefit from clarity about what the tool will and will not do. Vague instructions produce vague behavior.
