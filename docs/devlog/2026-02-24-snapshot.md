# Dev Blog: Project Snapshot — Feb 24, 2026

## What we're building

A two-stage LoRA fine-tuning pipeline for a language-learning assistant. Stage 1 trains a "Core Linguist" on Qwen3-8B. Stage 2 branches into language-specific and learner-specific variants. The target user: non-native English speakers working through TOEFL-level material, getting adaptive scaffolding instead of red-pen corrections.

The idea is simple. When a student says "Yesterday I go to the store," the model doesn't say "Wrong. Use past tense." It says "Oh, you went to the store? What did you pick up?" The correction lives inside a natural reply. The student hears the right form without feeling corrected.

## Where we are

**Stage 1 training is done.** Run 4 finished clean: 671 steps, 14 checkpoints, rank-16 LoRA on Qwen3-8B. The v3 training mix is 43,170 records pulled from LMSYS (40%), Magpie (25%), TOEFL synthetic (20%), Prosocial (10%), and a pilot set (5%). Perplexity dropped from 6.52 (base) to 3.45 (step 650), with convergence flattening after step 350.

**Eval is blocked.** The adapter weights live on Tinker cloud storage, not on local disk. We ran perplexity remotely on Feb 21-22 via Tinker's sampling API, but haven't done the manual quality pass yet. That's the next gate: 20-30 inference samples across scaffolding, grammar, tone, and dialogue flow to pick between step 350 and the final checkpoint.

**Dataset pipeline keeps growing.** We hit 34,000 rows tonight across 7 JSONL files. The latest addition: a batch generator running gemma3-27b locally through Ollama, producing TOEFL-style scaffolding dialogues. The system prompt rotates every 2,500 entries through four pedagogical approaches:

1. **Recast** — weave the correction into a natural follow-up
2. **Elicitation** — ask clarification questions that prompt self-correction
3. **Expansion** — build on their idea using the correct form
4. **Metalinguistic hints** — gentle nudges toward the grammar rule

The generator pulls from a bank of 54 seed errors covering article omission, tense confusion, subject-verb agreement, preposition transfer, word order, and a dozen other L1-interference patterns common in TOEFL test-takers from Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, and Korean backgrounds.

## The gallery (a side quest that grew legs)

While waiting on training infra, we built a creative coding gallery. 27 HTML canvas visualizations, all self-contained, dark theme, no dependencies. Boids, Lorenz attractors, L-systems, Truchet tiles, cellular automata. Each one gets a "back to gallery" button that hides itself when loaded in an iframe. Two new pieces landed today: a cell mitosis simulation and a pendulum wave.

The gallery started as a way to test GitHub Pages deployment. It turned into a portfolio piece. Every Saturday night, the two bots (Quimbot and Petrarch) meet in Discord to curate what goes on the showcase site.

## The CAIL docs

The CUNY AI Lab documentation is a parallel track. We're writing instructor-facing guides for an Open WebUI deployment: how to build custom models, write system prompts, create knowledge bases, onboard students. The docs ship as a single-page app with a sidebar nav, rendering markdown files on the fly.

This week's push: compressing the copy. The original drafts were padded. "Why This Matters" sections appeared in 7 of 14 files, each restating what the page title already said. We merged two pages (Basic Concepts + Quick Tour) into a single "Sandbox Basics" page, cutting 375 lines to 65. The getting-started guide lost its temperature slider explanation and gained a workspace access gate.

Writing rule we're enforcing: first mention of "model" in any section says "AI model." After that, use "model," "base model," or "custom model" as context demands. Small thing. Reads cleaner.

## What's next

1. **Run the eval pass.** Download or remote-load the Run 4 adapters. Compare step 350 vs final on real inference tasks. Pick the deployment candidate.
2. **Finish the 10k batch.** The Ollama generator is churning at ~400 samples/hour. At that rate, the full 10k takes about 25 hours. It supports resume, so restarts are cheap.
3. **Stage 2 dataset design.** Spanish SFT from latam-gpt (~1.1M rows) is the leading candidate. Need to draft filtering criteria and mixing ratios.
4. **OpenRouter billing.** HTTP 402 has blocked all cloud-based synthetic generation for days. Need to resolve or commit fully to local generation via Ollama.

## Numbers

- 130 commits in the last 5 days
- 34,000+ training rows across 7 dataset files
- 27 gallery visualizations
- 14 CAIL documentation pages (and shrinking)
- 2 bots coordinating in Discord
- 1 fine-tuning run complete, waiting on eval

## The setup

Two AI agents share a Discord server with the project owner. Quimbot (OpenClaw/Claude) handles implementation: writing code, generating data, building visualizations, editing docs. Petrarch (Clawdbot/Claude) handles planning: dataset design, eval methodology, architecture decisions, code review. They talk to each other in #orchestra threads, review each other's commits, and occasionally step on each other's toes.

The human steers. Drops in with a link, a correction, a direction change. "Make sure no repeats." "Condense the excess language." "Variegate the system prompt." The bots execute, report back, and keep moving.

It works better than it should.
