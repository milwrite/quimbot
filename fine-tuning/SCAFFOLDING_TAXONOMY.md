# Scaffolding Dialogue Taxonomy (Adaptive, Dialogic Learning)

**Purpose:** Categorize response types for learner-centered tutoring. Emphasis on adaptive scaffolding, dialogic learning, and conversational inquiry.

## 1) Recasting (Implicit Modeling)
**Definition:** Respond by naturally restating the learner’s utterance in correct form without explicit correction.
**Use when:** Error is minor; keep flow; emphasize comprehension.
**Example:**
- Learner: “She is teacher.”
- Tutor: “She is **a** teacher—what does she teach?”

## 2) Clarifying Questions (Socratic Prompting)
**Definition:** Ask targeted questions that guide the learner to notice form or meaning.
**Use when:** The learner is close; prompt discovery.
**Example:**
- Learner: “Yesterday I go to school.”
- Tutor: “Yesterday… that’s past time. How does *go* change in the past?”

## 3) Confirmation Checks (Comprehension + Validation)
**Definition:** Confirm understanding while gently extending.
**Use when:** Learner is correct but minimal; encourage elaboration.
**Example:**
- Learner: “Three book.”
- Tutor: “Three **books**, right? What kinds of books?”

## 4) Expansion Prompts (Elaboration)
**Definition:** Encourage more detail, adding a natural model in the follow‑up.
**Use when:** Learner response is brief; build fluency.
**Example:**
- Learner: “I like cooking.”
- Tutor: “Nice! What do you like to cook most?”

## 5) Choice Framing (Contrastive Inquiry)
**Definition:** Offer two options and ask which sounds better.
**Use when:** Error is pattern-based; quick self‑correction.
**Example:**
- “Which sounds better: *three book* or *three books*?”

## 6) Hinting (Minimal Cues)
**Definition:** Provide a subtle clue rather than an answer.
**Use when:** Learner needs nudge, not correction.
**Example:**
- “We’re talking about *yesterday*… what tense is that?”

## 7) Reflective Questioning (Metacognitive)
**Definition:** Ask learner to reflect on rules they’re using.
**Use when:** Learner is intermediate; build self‑monitoring.
**Example:**
- “Why do you think we add **-s** with ‘he/she/it’?”

## 8) Gentle Repetition (Uptake)
**Definition:** Repeat the learner’s idea with slight correction embedded.
**Use when:** Preserve learner intent; avoid interruption.
**Example:**
- Learner: “I go yesterday.”
- Tutor: “You **went** yesterday—got it. What did you do after?”

## 9) Affective Support (Encouragement)
**Definition:** Affirm effort to reduce anxiety and sustain engagement.
**Use when:** Learner hesitates or makes repeated errors.
**Example:**
- “That’s a good start—let’s try one more together.”

## 10) Adaptive Simplification
**Definition:** Simplify language or break tasks into smaller steps.
**Use when:** Learner shows confusion; avoid overload.
**Example:**
- “Let’s try a shorter sentence first, then we’ll expand it.”

## Mapping to Scaffolding Goals
- **Adaptive Scaffolding:** 1, 2, 6, 10
- **Dialogic Learning:** 2, 4, 5, 7
- **Conversational Inquiry:** 2, 5, 7
- **Affective Safety:** 3, 8, 9

## Guidance for Dataset Tagging
Label each dialogue with the dominant strategy above (e.g., `recast`, `clarify_q`, `contrastive_choice`) to support targeted fine‑tuning or evaluation.
