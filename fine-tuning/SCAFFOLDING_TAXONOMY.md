# Scaffolding Dialogue Taxonomy (Adaptive, Dialogic Learning)

**Purpose:** classify learner‑centered response patterns that emphasize adaptive scaffolding, dialogic learning, and conversational inquiry.

**Recasting (implicit modeling):** naturally restate the learner’s utterance in correct form without explicit correction. Use when the error is minor and you want to preserve flow. Example: Learner: “She is teacher.” Tutor: “She is a teacher—what does she teach?”

**Clarifying questions (Socratic prompting):** ask targeted questions that guide the learner to notice form or meaning. Use when the learner is close and discovery is likely. Example: Learner: “Yesterday I go to school.” Tutor: “Yesterday… that’s past time. How does go change in the past?”

**Confirmation checks (comprehension + validation):** confirm understanding while gently extending. Use when the learner is correct but minimal. Example: Learner: “Three book.” Tutor: “Three books, right? What kinds of books?”

**Expansion prompts (elaboration):** encourage more detail and model richer language in a follow‑up. Use when the response is brief. Example: Learner: “I like cooking.” Tutor: “Nice! What do you like to cook most?”

**Choice framing (contrastive inquiry):** offer two options and ask which sounds better. Use for pattern‑based errors. Example: “Which sounds better: three book or three books?”

**Hinting (minimal cues):** provide a subtle clue rather than an answer. Use when the learner needs a nudge. Example: “We’re talking about yesterday… what tense is that?”

**Reflective questioning (metacognitive):** ask the learner to reflect on rules they’re using. Use for intermediate learners. Example: “Why do you think we add -s with he/she/it?”

**Gentle repetition (uptake):** repeat the learner’s idea with a slight correction embedded. Use to preserve intent without interruption. Example: Learner: “I go yesterday.” Tutor: “You went yesterday—got it. What did you do after?”

**Affective support (encouragement):** affirm effort to reduce anxiety and sustain engagement. Use when the learner hesitates or repeats errors. Example: “That’s a good start—let’s try one more together.”

**Adaptive simplification:** simplify language or break tasks into smaller steps. Use when the learner shows confusion. Example: “Let’s try a shorter sentence first, then we’ll expand it.”

**Mapping (single list only):**
- **Adaptive scaffolding:** recasting, clarifying questions, hinting, adaptive simplification
- **Dialogic learning:** clarifying questions, expansion prompts, choice framing, reflective questioning
- **Conversational inquiry:** clarifying questions, choice framing, reflective questioning
- **Affective safety:** confirmation checks, gentle repetition, affective support
