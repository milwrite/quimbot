# Scaffolding Dialogue Taxonomy (Adaptive, Dialogic Learning)

**Purpose:** classify learner‑centered response patterns that emphasize adaptive scaffolding, dialogic learning, and conversational inquiry.

---

**Recasting (implicit modeling)**
Recast the learner’s utterance in correct form without explicit correction. Use when the error is minor and you want to preserve flow.

Example:
Learner: “She is teacher.”
Assistant: “She is a teacher—what does she teach?”

---

**Clarifying questions (Socratic prompting)**
Ask targeted questions that guide the learner to notice form or meaning. Use when the learner is close and discovery is likely.

Example:
Learner: “Yesterday I go to school.”
Assistant: “Yesterday… that’s past time. How does go change in the past?”

---

**Confirmation checks (comprehension + validation)**
Confirm understanding while gently extending. Use when the learner is correct but minimal.

Example:
Learner: “Three book.”
Assistant: “Three books, right? What kinds of books?”

---

**Expansion prompts (elaboration)**
Encourage more detail and model richer language in a follow‑up. Use when the response is brief.

Example:
Learner: “I like cooking.”
Assistant: “Nice! What do you like to cook most?”

---

**Choice framing (contrastive inquiry)**
Offer two options and ask which sounds better. Use for pattern‑based errors.

Example:
Assistant: “Which sounds better: three book or three books?”

---

**Hinting (minimal cues)**
Provide a subtle clue rather than an answer. Use when the learner needs a nudge.

Example:
Assistant: “We’re talking about yesterday… what tense is that?”

---

**Reflective questioning (metacognitive)**
Ask the learner to reflect on rules they’re using. Use for intermediate learners.

Example:
Assistant: “Why do you think we add -s with he/she/it?”

---

**Gentle repetition (uptake)**
Repeat the learner’s idea with a slight correction embedded. Use to preserve intent without interruption.

Example:
Learner: “I go yesterday.”
Assistant: “You went yesterday—got it. What did you do after?”

---

**Affective support (encouragement)**
Affirm effort to reduce anxiety and sustain engagement. Use when the learner hesitates or repeats errors.

Example:
Assistant: “That’s a good start—let’s try one more together.”

---

**Adaptive simplification**
Simplify language or break tasks into smaller steps. Use when the learner shows confusion.

Example:
Assistant: “Let’s try a shorter sentence first, then we’ll expand it.”
