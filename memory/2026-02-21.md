# 2026-02-21

- 07:00 Morning stand-up posted to #orchestra
- Re-confirmed Stage 1 mix file intact: 43,175 lines, valid schema
- Waiting on Petrarch to bless supersets + mix for LoRA training kickoff
- OpenRouter 402 presumably still active
- 08:47 Morning gallery creation: built 2 new visualizations
  - **Heat Diffusion** (heat.html): 2D thermal diffusion with drifting sources, click-to-add interaction, black-red-orange-yellow-white palette
  - **Turing Patterns** (turing.html): Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, coral growth preset (f=0.037, k=0.06), ocean-coral color map, click to seed
  - Registered in gallery index.html, committed, pushed (resolved KANBAN merge conflict, accepted remote)
  - Posted to #orchestra, tagged Petrarch
- 13:47 Session compaction snapshot:
  - **Stage 1 mix final**: `stage1_mix_v2_20260220.jsonl` — 43,175 records, ratios locked (LMSYS 40.8/Magpie 25.5/TOEFL 20.4/Prosocial 10.2/Pilot 3.2)
  - **Gallery**: 15 artifacts total (latest commit `972de83`), iframe previews on index
  - **Historical art in progress**: Nake "Walk-Through Raster" (me drafting), Mohr P-021 (Petrarch drafting)
  - **Blockers**: OpenRouter 402 (milwrite), gateway token mismatch (needs `openclaw gateway restart`)
  - **HEARTBEAT.md**: 11PM nightly optimization + 9AM gallery creation schedules written, cron not registered yet
  - **Missing gallery vis files**: `vis_constraint_grid.js`, `vis_vibecoding.js`, `vis_dataflow.js` in registry but not on disk
  - **Spanish SFT datasets**: found 5 from `latam-gpt` org on HF (~1.1M rows) for potential Stage 2
- 21:21 **Stage 1 Run 4 launched** on v3 mix (43,170 records), Qwen/Qwen3-8B, LoRA rank 16, batch 64, LR 1e-4
- ~22:15 **Stage 1 Run 4 COMPLETE**: 671 steps, 14 checkpoints (every 50 + final)
  - Run ID: `1409ede0-689d-53a9-af07-a2426cf4f218:train:0`
  - No crashes (overlength samples filtered in v3)
  - Log: `fine-tuning/data/stage1_run4_v3.log`
  - **EVAL:** 2/22: Perplexity drops rapidly early. Step 350 roughly optimal. Cloud eval stalled at final, truncating.
- 19:00 milwrite requested:
  - README updated to include gallery, reddit scraper, models, side quests (pushed `80b5504`)
  - Petrarch added OpenClaw integration section (pushed `224ee39`)
  - Petrarch transformed milwrite.github.io/quimbot/ from gallery-only to three-tab hub (Creative Coding / Workflows / Dev Docs)
  - **Standing weekly meeting**: Saturday 10 PM ET, Quimbot + Petrarch in #orchestra to curate the site. Quimbot implements, Petrarch reviews.
  - Cron for Saturday meeting BLOCKED by gateway token mismatch. Register once gateway is restarted.

## LoRA Training Runs (Stage 1)

- **Run 1** (07:01, batch=64): Reached step 268/674 before SIGKILL. Checkpoint saved at step 100: `tinker://68176a5e-2d63-50a6-aed5-ebe54ea644e9:train:0/sampler_weights/step_0100`
- **Run 2** (07:17, batch=32): SIGKILL after ~step 42. No checkpoint saved.
- **Run 3** (13:46, batch=16): Started via `setsid` (fully detached). Logging to `fine-tuning/training_run_stage1_v3.log`. 2698 total steps, checkpoints every 50. Running as of 14:38.
- Training backend: Tinker SDK, base model `Qwen/Qwen3-8B`, LoRA rank 16, lr 1e-4
- Previous runs killed by OpenClaw exec session cleanup (not OOM; machine has 62GB RAM, 43GB free)
- Key learning: must use `setsid` + log to file for long training runs; OpenClaw kills child processes on session cleanup

## Gallery Expansion (Feb 20-21)

- Built and pushed: Noll Gaussian Quadratic, Harmonograph, Nake Walk-Through Raster
- Petrarch built: Lorenz attractor, Sospiri, favicon, back-to-gallery nav
- Total gallery artifacts: ~18 standalone HTML pages
- Gallery index redesigned: iframes restored with hard separation (preview container + solid info section)
- All pages patched: iframe detection hides overlays/controls when embedded
- milwrite feedback: "stop looping on decisions; if no progress don't report in" — noted, no more phantom standups
- `cuny-ai-lab/creative-coding` repo: milwrite said to completely forget about it, everything lives in `milwrite/quimbot`

## Evening Stocktake (19:30)

- **Stage 1 Run 3**: Reached step 2250/2698 (83%) with 45 checkpoints saved before crashing on seq length 33459 > 32768 limit. One long sample in the mix needs truncation or removal.
- **Fix needed**: Filter `stage1_mix_v2_20260220.jsonl` to cap token sequences at 32768, then resume from step 2250 checkpoint.
- Gallery at 18 artifacts, creative-coding repo up to date.

## Key Context

- Cen (cenliu) is a Discord member who asked for chinoiserie visualization and was up late stressed about a job application (NY Historical Society)
- Chopppa (chopppa32, ID 822471451399159819) is a Discord member; messages weren't being picked up due to timing/session gaps, not config issues
- Gateway token mismatch persists: can't use cron, config.get, or browser tools until resolved
- milwrite needs to run `openclaw gateway restart` from terminal
- 22:15 **Stage 1 LoRA Run 4 COMPLETE** ✅ — 671 steps, 14 checkpoints, Qwen3-8B rank 16 batch 64 lr 1e-4
  - v3 dataset: 43,170 records (5 overlong samples filtered from v2)
  - Final checkpoint: tinker://1409ede0-689d-53a9-af07-a2426cf4f218:train:0/sampler_weights/final
  - Next: evaluate final checkpoint, compare intermediates, then Stage 2
