## Workspace Migration
- Switched OpenClaw workspace root from `~/.openclaw/workspace` to `~/Quimbot`
- Updated `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `agents.defaults.workspace = /home/milwrite/Quimbot`
- Copied over SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, BOOTSTRAP.md, MEMORY.md, memory/
- Both directories are separate git clones of milwrite/quimbot; ~/Quimbot is now canonical
