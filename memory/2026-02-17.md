- ITP lab deck (quimbot repo): created `sidequests/next/itp-lab/slides.md` with audience-facing slide outline; pushed.
- GitHub Pages publish: repo Pages configured to serve from `main` + `/docs`; mirrored deck into `docs/itp-lab/` so it is live at `https://milwrite.github.io/quimbot/itp-lab/`.
- Next.js/GitHub Pages compatibility fixes:
  - Fixed module loading in `index.html` to compute base path for `/itp-lab` vs `/itp-lab/`.
  - Removed top-level `await` from module import for broader browser support.
  - Added visible `#loadError` overlay when module import fails.
- Mobile UX fixes:
  - Added tap + swipe navigation in `src/deck.js` (ignore taps inside `.stage`).
  - Improved mobile layout: hide header right meta block, allow slide scrolling, constrain `<pre>` overflow.
- Content cleanup:
  - Rewrote bullets to be presentation copy (audience-facing), removed meta notes; kept `slides.md` and `index.html` in sync.
  - Added Open WebUI registration link + instruction to put a 👍 in chat.
  - Updated Live Demo slide to mention Open WebUI “Configuration panel” (right side) and explicit model choice (GLM 5 / Kimi K2.5 MoE) with optional read-more: https://ailab.gc.cuny.edu/models/.
- Added two new creative-coding visualizations (no external deps): `vis_boids.js` and `vis_flowfield.js`; registered in `src/registry.js` and used on Slides 8 and 10 (later replaced Slide 10 with a screenshot).
- Added Open WebUI screenshot asset `assets/openwebui-kimi-k2.5.jpg` and embedded it into the signup/Live Demo slide (Slide 10).
