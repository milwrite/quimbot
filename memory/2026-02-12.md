## Devlog / status

- Added TOEFL-ish followup synthesis helper:
  - `fine-tuning/generate_toefl_followups_openrouter.py` (OpenRouter chat → strict JSON output → JSONL; supports 2/4/6–8 turn formats)
- Removed the Gemini-CLI scaffolding generator (we’re standardizing on the followups script).
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude OpenClaw agent/persona workspace files from the quimbot repo.

## Next

- Run a small pilot generation run with each script (100–500 samples) and validate schema/quality.
- Decide which format (2-turn followups vs 4-turn scaffolding) to prioritize for next Stage1 mix-in.
