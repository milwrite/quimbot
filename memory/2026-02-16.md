- Discord / #cron thread instruction (milwrite): **After scheduling any cron job**, post a follow-up confirmation message **in the #orchestra → cron thread** (<#1467738838846799953>) tagging relevant parties (Quimbot <@1467736354766196829>, Petrarch <@1464098720340508776>).

- Discord A2A fix: enabled `channels.discord.allowBots: true` in OpenClaw config, restarted gateway; confirmed bot↔bot visibility between Quimbot (<@1467736354766196829>) and Petrarch/Clawdbot PI (<@1464098720340508776>). Also confirmed `guilds.<guildId>.requireMention: true` scoping works for keeping bots quiet unless mentioned.

- Microlearning sidequest scaffold: created/pushed `sidequests/microlearning/` in `milwrite/quimbot` with canonical JSON Schemas (`topic_record`, `shortlist_record`, `approval_record`, `content_packet`), examples, and scoring notes.

- Git ops: push initially failed due to remote ahead; rebased with conflict in `KANBAN.md` (resolved), then pushed successfully.

- Microlearning scoring improvement: implemented explicit subreddit prior weights to reduce r/todayilearned dominance (e.g., `todayilearned: 0.7`) in `sidequests/microlearning/score_topics.py` and pushed commit `e463b77`.

- Reddit scraping reliability: running `sidequests/microlearning/scrape_reddit.py` via OAuth works on Legion (generated `topics_20260216_2102.jsonl` with 119 records). Petrarch reported a Mac Studio 403-block incident earlier, likely environment/IP/config-specific.

- Cross-machine microlearning pipeline work (Petrarch): scraper+proposer moved into `milwrite/quimbot/sidequests/microlearning/scraper/` (commit `f0ca1ff` per Petrarch) with hourly batches; multiple candidate batches posted throughout the day.

- Microlearning scripts: Petrarch generated 12 candidate scripts (24 variants: animated + documentary) and committed `ce3f9e0` under `sidequests/microlearning/scripts/` (Detroit script reviewed and looks strong).

- Messaging: sent update to Discord channel `1472986740125077554` summarizing microlearning batch triage + need to standardize `run_id`.
