# Starter Kit

Welcome to the CUNY AI Lab Sandbox. This kit covers everything you need for your first session: logging in, having your first conversation, and finding your way around the interface.

You do not need any prior experience with AI tools. If you have used ChatGPT or a similar chatbot, the basics will feel familiar. If you have not, that is fine too. Start here.

## What's in the Starter Kit

- **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** — Log in, have your first conversation, explore the interface, and customize your settings.

## When You're Ready for More

Once you are comfortable with the basics, head to the **[Design Kit](../design-kit/index.md)** to start building custom AI configurations for your courses and research.
