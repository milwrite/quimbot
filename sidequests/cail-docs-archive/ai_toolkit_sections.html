    <h1>About AI</h1>
    <p >Welcome to the <strong>About AI</strong> page of the <strong>Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit</strong>. <img  src="https://aitoolkit.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/29149/files/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-29-at-2.16.06 AM-298x300.png" alt="Flowchart Network" width="154" height="155" /></p>
<p >Understanding the terms and principles of artificial intelligence (AI) is integral to AI literacy. The materials compiled below assume an FAQ format to support your working vocabulary of key terms in the field today. This is followed by visual supports meant to demystify generative AI models for more visual learners.</p>

<h2>Artificial intelligence <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
<strong><details><summary>What is artificial intelligence?</summary></strong>

AI is not a recent or looming development. Rather, from predictive policing to targeted advertising, it is a past and present reality that has imprinted itself on various aspects of our lives.

The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in the 1950s to encapsulate theories and efforts to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. The goal was to engineer a computer capable of undertaking activities that were previously limited to the cognitive abilities of humans, be it chess strategy or affect recognition (<a href="https://sites.broadviewpress.com/ai/talking/">Woolridge 2021</a>).

Today, we still commonly and somewhat simplistically refer to artificial intelligence as the science of building computer systems capable of executing tasks that previously required the intellectual processes and knowledge work of human beings (<a href="https://sites.broadviewpress.com/ai/talking/">Dobrin 2023</a>).

Issues raised by AI systems in education not only concern classroom instruction but also encompass broader aspects of the educational ecosystem, such as student privacy and data rights, curriculum design and development, administrative processes, labor politics, and more.

</details>

<strong><details><summary>What is training data?</summary></strong>

Training data refers to the information that is used to teach an AI system how to perform certain tasks. Think of it as the curricular content from which AI systems learn to make certain predictions or decisions. If that curriculum is flawed or biased, AI will be as well.

<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G/">Consider the strikingly biased outcomes</a> produced by Amazon's AI-driven recruitment tool. This system independently developed a preference for male candidates, and it lowered the rankings of resumes featuring terms like "women's," such as "women's chess club captain," or resumes from graduates of exclusively women's colleges.

Now suppose a college or university employs an AI system to assist in the admissions process. That AI system would rely heavily on historical admissions data to predict which applicants are most likely to succeed at the institution. Biased historical data used by AI to admit or reject applicants would further disadvantage historically marginalized groups and communities.

Faculty and staff should consider these dangers in terms of CUNY's historic mission to educate <em>the children of the whole people</em>, including those who have been disproportionately marginalized or underrepresented in higher education.

</details>

<strong><details><summary>What is machine learning?</summary></strong>

Machine learning is a subset of AI that gives computers the ability to learn and adapt from experience without being explicitly programmed. Think of it as similar to learning how to ride a bike. With practice and iteration, you get better at it. Machine learning enables a computer to refine its performance as it processes more and more data over time.

<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/07/19/georgia-state-improves-student-outcomes-data">Georgia State University is cited</a> as a success story in using  machine learning to identify students at risk of dropping out and provide timely interventions. While the university's efforts have led to gains in graduation rates, the jury's still out on whether such institutional initiatives lead to the disproportionate flagging of students from underrepresented minority groups, or privacy issues related to its extensive surveillance and data monitoring practices.

</details>

<strong><details><summary>What is a neural network?</summary></strong>

A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempts to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process modeled on how the human brain operates. Neural networks are designed to cluster and classify information. Think of them as a web of interconnected nodes that work together to understand complex patterns in data.

</details>
<h2 >Generative artificial intelligence <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
<strong><details><summary>What is generative artificial intelligence?</summary> </strong>

Generative artificial intelligence refers to a subset of AI technologies with the capability to generate diverse forms of content — such as alphabetic texts, visual art, and audio — by recognizing and reproducing various patterns in datasets.

When a user inputs a command asking for something specific — be it a written piece, a musical piece, a graphic, or a solution to a mathematical problem — generative AI begins by sifting through its database. It searches for recurring themes and pertinent information related to the requested item, then rearranges gathered information into a new sequence that it deems most fitting in response to the user’s initial request (<a href="https://sites.broadviewpress.com/ai/talking/">Dobrin 2023</a>).

</details>

<strong><details><summary>What is AI text generation?</summary></strong>

AI text generation is the process by which a computer program uses methods in artificial intelligence to produce written content autonomously. Using patterns and structures learned from vast databases of human language, today’s text generators can formulate coherent and contextual material ranging from simple advertisements to lengthy articles. The technology of AI text generation underlies the conversational chatbots you interact with online, along with the predictive text features on your smartphone and/or email service.

As AI text generation has become more prevalent, critical perspectives focus on its tendency to flatten language differences, dehumanize composing practices, and co-opt vast quantities of online writing and text communication. In particular, educators should take note of how these tools could lead to a narrowing of linguistic expression and a subsequent devaluing of the diverse perspectives and voices that CUNY students in particular bring to their written work.

</details>

<strong><details><summary>What is AI image generation?</summary></strong>

AI image generation involves the creation of visual media from scratch or existing images via machine learning models. These AI systems learn from vast collections of visual media and can generate novel images that may be difficult to distinguish from those created by humans.

This form of generative AI invites scrutiny around the ethics of representation, the dangers of ready-made deepfakes, and infringements on intellectual property rights across a range of visual media.

</details>

<strong><details><summary>What are large language models?</summary></strong>

The term "large language models" stems from the development process for AI; this involves training on extensive collections of textual data to predict and approximate human language patterns. Laquintano and colleagues explain that for creating text, these models are fed vast amounts of information, predominantly sourced from the internet, and are trained using advanced machine learning methods. Following their initial training, these models undergo additional refinement and enhancement through processes like “reinforcement learning from human feedback” (RLHF) to improve the quality and relevance of their outputs. This approach has significantly advanced the generative AI sector over the past decade, with a notable surge since the end of 2017. Such advancements have led to the emergence of 'foundation models' that are versatile at generating text, images, videos, or audio for a variety of applications.

Training large language models (LLMs) through RLHF raises considerable ethical and political concerns around the material conditions of these labor practices. These include inadequate compensation, poor working conditions for data labelers, and a lack of transparency and recognition for the essential role these workers play in the development and accuracy of LLMs.

<a href="https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/">A TIME report</a> indicated that OpenAI outsourced tasks to Kenyan workers who were paid less than $2 per hour to help make ChatGPT less toxic. These workers reported being mentally scarred by the disturbing content they had to process, and the problematic work environment led to the early termination of the contract with Sama, the firm that employed these workers, in February 2022. These revelations highlight important ethical considerations in the AI development process, particularly regarding labor practices and the psychological wellbeing of those involved in content moderation and model training.

</details>

<strong><details><summary>What does ChatGPT stand for and what does it mean?</summary></strong>

ChatGPT stands for "Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer" and denotes a specific type of AI technology designed to understand and predictively generate text in a conversational context.
<ul>
 	<li>"<strong>Generative"</strong> signifies its ability to create text, extrapolating from given prompts to produce new content.</li>
 	<li><strong>"Pre-trained"</strong> indicates that the model has been initially trained on a vast array of text data, enabling it to understand language patterns.</li>
 	<li><strong>"Transformer"</strong> describes the foundational neural network structure of the model, which excels in interpreting sequences of text and discerning the semantic connections between different textual elements.</li>
</ul>
Let's reframe as building a sandcastle on the beach.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>“Generative”</strong> signifies the ability for ChatGPT to turn the raw materials of sand into “new” structures that resemble sandcastles built by humans</li>
 	<li>"<strong>Pre-trained"</strong> involves the process by which ChatGPT recognizes and adopt patterns like how wet the sand should be or which molds work best on a humid or rainy day.</li>
 	<li><strong>"Transformer"</strong> describes the framework of buckets, shovels, and techniques used by ChatGPT to cohere different sections of the sandcastle into a uniform whole.</li>
</ul>
Just as these elements work together to create a really cool sandcastle, so does ChatGPT's combination of generative capabilities, pre-training practices, and transformer architecture allow it to produce contextual outputs in response to user input.

</details>

<strong><details><summary>What is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)?</summary></strong>

RLHF is an important technique used to fine-tune AI models in which human feedback helps fine-tune and constrain large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Broadly speaking, it involves three stages:
<ol>
 	<li>Human labelers provide desired outputs for specific prompts, creating a dataset used to train a supervised learning model;</li>
 	<li>The model then generates multiple outputs based on those prompts for human labelers to rank from best to worst, which affords ranking data that informs the reward scheme;</li>
 	<li>When a new prompt is sampled, the model can then generate an output based on its updated parameters, with reward model calculating used iteratively to update those parameters to yield contextual improvements outputs over time.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">While RLHF has significantly improved the alignment of AI models with human preferences, it also raises ethical concerns related to the labor and well-being of the human annotators involved in the training process. These concerns include exposure to harmful or disturbing content, inadequate compensation, and lack of recognition for their contributions. Addressing these issues is essential to ensure that the development of AI technologies is conducted responsibly and ethically, prioritizing the welfare of all individuals involve</p>

<h3>The Importance of Human Feedback</h3>
In OpenAI’s work on aligning language models to follow instructions with human feedback, the company identifies <a href="https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences">reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)</a> as a core technique used to train ChatGPT-X and InstructGPT models. In their research post on the topic, OpenAI authors Ryan Lowe and Jan Leike include a three-step visualization to explain this technique, which “uses human preferences as a reward signal to fine-tune [their] models” in ways that “aren’t fully captured by simple automatic metrics.”

Shown below are those three steps:

  <!-- ASSIGNMENT MAKEOVERS -->

    <div class="breadcrumb"><a href="#">Docs</a> / AI Toolkit / <a href="#assignment-makeovers">Assignment Makeovers</a></div>
    <h1>Assignment Makeovers</h1>
    The Assignment Makeover section of the Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit provides guidance for thinking through how your assignments may or may not interact with generative AI, followed by a discussion of scaffolding learning and emphasizing process as starting points for considering AI's impact on assignment design. It then covers how to do an “assignment makeover” with the goal of discerning and responding to potential AI uses by students as part of an assignment. The section concludes with an invitation for instructors to visualize their assignments from the unique and varied standpoints of their students.
<h2>Back to Basics <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
The mainstreaming and commercialization of generative AI tools has made it difficult to overstate the value of well-crafted assignment design. Instructors might consider a "back-to-basics mentality" when it comes to redesigning assignments, paying careful attention to its sequence of activities and the capacity for generative AI to replace or enhance steps along the way.

In his recent <em>Inside Higher Ed</em> post — <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/blogs/just-visiting/2023/09/20/chatgpt-shows-way-toward-our-own-humanity">If ChatGPT Can Do It, It’s Not Worth Doing</a> — John Warner moves the needle on this point<em>: </em>"If a large language model (like ChatGPT or its brethren) can generate a product similar to or better than humans on the same writing task, that writing task is not worth doing."

In turn, <a href="https://derekbruff.org/?p=4105">Derek Bruff</a>, author of <a href="https://wvupressonline.com/node/803"><em>Intentional Tech: Principles to Guide the Use of Educational Technology in College Teaching</em></a>, advises instructors to answer the six-question framework below:
<ul>
 	<li ><strong>Why is this assignment fitting for the course?</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>What are the specific learning objectives?</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>How might students utilize AI tools in this assignment?</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Can AI undermine the assignment's goals, and how can we counteract this?</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>In what ways can AI enhance the assignment?</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li ><strong>How can the process be made more meaningful and supportive for students?</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Scaffolding Learning <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
To scaffold an assignment involves segmenting its broader requirements into smaller and more manageable building blocks. Scaffolding informal exercises and low-stakes activities into a larger assignments frames learning as an unfolding process of growth and discovery, rather than a product or problem in need of streamlining or automation.

<a href="https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/teach-cuny-handbook-v-5-0-2022/section/50d21b8f-8398-4aeb-a63a-60b043c6b49e#node-a376446a27056987e3a5f38c6a14c0f0572f4b97">The Teach@CUNY Handbook</a> elaborates further on the value of scaffolding in assignment design:
<p ><em>In assignment design, scaffolding refers to a process where assignments begin with a series of low-stakes (low grade impact) exercises which build up to a final, larger assignment. Scaffolding allows you to break down the component parts of a skill or assignment and to offer students the opportunity to check in and receive feedback at each juncture. In this way, scaffolding is both a planning and learning tool and follows a similar process to backwards design to consider what a student needs to know in order to complete a task or assignment. For many students, especially those who are not familiar with what goes into larger academic assignments, it is very important to make potential structures and processes for completing larger projects more visible. Modeling that building academic work is an iterative process can help students tackle more complex projects later on in their careers.</em></p>
Scaffolding learning can offer students a framework of accountability that is often lacking in projects or assignments that require only a single submission. Encouraging students to leave traces of their learning process can also provide usable insights for instructors who have yet to update the design of their assignment to accommodate potential uses of generative AI by students.

As acts of revision and recursion become more visible over time, scaffolding techniques can affirm for students that knowledge production does not follow a linear trajectory or a straightforward march from not-knowing to knowing. Instead, it can foster a critical and reflexive habit of mind that unfolds over iterative cycles of reevaluation, refinement, and rethinking. This mindset is integral in the fast-changing landscape of generative AI, where students need tools and strategies to visualize themselves and their thinking in deliberative, ever-evolving terms.
<h2>Taking Activity Inventories <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
Instructors tasked with remaking an assignment to accommodate AI can conduct what is called an “activity inventory.” This exercise involves making a list of every cognitive task required to complete the assignment, Remember when you were asked to make a exhaustive list of steps for how to make a PB&amp;J sandwich in elementary school? That’s an activity inventory.

In turn, it asks instructors to kick the tires of an assignment to better understand its core activities, identifying which tasks can be automated or replaced, and determining opportunities for revising the directions or format of the assignment. Doing so opens avenues for instructors to improve their assignment’s design, while simultaneously calibrating it to realities of AI use in their class.
<h2>Stress Testing Assignments <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
<a href="https://www.writinginstitute.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/PDFs/stress_testing_writing_assignments_6.1.23.pdf">In a workshop on AI and the teaching of writing</a>, Tim Laquintano and Annette Vee suggest instructors attempt their own assignments by using ChatGPT to reengineer its required activities in the same sequence expected of their students. By inputting the assignment prompts into the AI tool, instructors can assess how the tool approaches and completes the assignment.

Stress testing helps identify potential weaknesses or loopholes that students might exploit using AI, and therefore enables educators to modify the assignment to ensure it requires more space for critical thinking, metacognition, or reflective practice, which generative AI tools cannot easily replicate. The goal of this process is not only to maintain academic integrity among students, but to also remake assignments that allow instructors to understand and assess students for their genuine understanding of the topic, and to invite authentic learning experiences that exceed the classroom, not to mention the chatbot interface.
<h2>Visualizing Student Perspectives <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
Like most people, students come to use generative AI for a variety of reasons. Surely there are students for whom generative AI is nothing but a shortcut. But instructors should not forget those who use these technology for learning support, who benefit from its adaptability and reach, its concision and clarity of expression, or even its capacity to translate vague or complicated assignments into something they can understand. Others may use it because they aren't confident in their writing, or are being asked to produce work in a language other than their native tongue.

It helps to keep learner perspectives in mind when remaking assignments that accommodate tools like ChatGPT, given the diverse life circumstances of CUNY students. Stepping into their shoes can inspire new heuristics for how to stress test and mold assignments to the needs of the moment. Visualizing CUNY student perspectives can also promote an ethics of care in the classroom, which supports students in efforts to reconcile their own proximity to these tools and the complicated, busy lives they often lead.
<p >Imagine the student crunched for time and faced with the two options: submit their paper after the deadline and fail the course, or submit an ersatz paper using ChatGPT to pass the class and advance to their degree.</p>
What would you do? When is it acceptable to prioritize the convenience of technology over the labor of hard work? These are questions worth asking, no matter your discipline or pedagogy.

    <h1>Course Policies</h1>
    Welcome to the Course Policy section of the Teach<span class="">@</span>CUNY AI Toolkit. Here, instructors can find guidance and models for developing clear, transparent expectations for student use of AI. The section starts with initial considerations and tips for setting course policy on AI use in the classroom, and then offers a range of policy statements that instructors can adapt to their syllabi. It then provides sample attribution statements, followed by guidelines for promoting academic integrity.
<h2>Initial Considerations <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
Let’s be clear. Plenty of CUNY students, faculty, and staff already use generative AI tools. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for managing this technology, and avoidance is not the answer. AI detection software fails to deliver on its promises, and use of detection tools can wrongly penalize and harm students. AI detection tools have been found to incorrectly flag students' work as generated by AI tools (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/02/turnitin-ai-cheating-detector-accuracy/)">Fowler 2023</a>) and these detection tools are more likely to label text written by non-native English speakers as AI-written (<a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-detectors-biased-against-non-native-english-writers">Myers 2023</a>). For the most part, institutional bans against AI tools have been ineffective.

Teaching Matters: Special Series on Generative AI, November 2023.[/caption]

A more effective starting point is to experiment with generative AI technology, and tinker with tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney. Take note of glitches and red flags. Preserve or screencapture any AI outputs that excite or unsettle you, or which represent the affordances and drawbacks of the technology when applied to student learning.

In time, ask yourself — how might generative AI impact not only how I teach, but also how my students learn? What pedagogical opportunities may be made possible or more feasible through the adoption of this technology? What tools threaten to automate learning processes, and how might these ultimately constrain critical and creative thinking among students?

<a href="https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/ctl/chatgpt-its-impact-on-teaching-in-spring-2023/">The Baruch Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL)</a> suggests that instructors explore ChatGPT to assess first hand its potential role in teaching and learning. Instructors who experiment with ChatGPT can improve their working knowledge of how these tools function, what they do well, and where their limitations and boundaries lie. These experiences can guide instructors toward a more critical and functional awareness of these tools and their place in college instruction.

Student needs should also inform the adoption of generative AI in the classroom. This requires reflecting upon how AI tools might support students as they navigate different stages of the learning process in different disciplines. It also requires thinking through what it means if generative AI can credibly replace intermediary steps in a learning process. Should that learning design be revised or replaced?
<h2>Setting Policy <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
To find a productive balance between uncritical acceptance and prohibition, instructors should view AI course policy options on a spectrum. The perils and promises of generative AI are both very real, and require thoughtful reflection before instructors settle on an AI course policy.

Too often, course policies are designed to police student behavior and uphold academic mores. Yet strict policy statements can stunt student creativity and strain student-teacher relationships. Instructors might consider how to articulate AI course policies that promote self-advocacy and growth mindset among students, rather than simply imposing strict controls or punitive measures around the use of these tools in their class.

At the same time, in this moment of change and sense making, course policies that permit open use of AI technology would benefit from class time devoted to active learning opportunities with AI. Here, instructors may consider teaching strategies that promote their students’ critical and functional awareness of AI tools, using holistic, process-oriented instruction to light the way.

Instructors might also set course policy on the basis of direct and open discussions with their students. This provides a chance to learn more about how students are using AI technology, and to refine approaches in dialogue with <i>actual </i>rather than imagined uses of these tools.
<h2>Policy Statements <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
Drawing on the work of educators at <a href="https://teaching.uoregon.edu/teaching-and-generative-ai">The University of Oregon</a> and <a href="https://genai.sites.gettysburg.edu/positions-and-policies/">Gettysburg College</a>, examples below provide a range of syllabi language on AI for instructors to select from as they work toward a policy statement that addresses the unique needs of their class and student learners.
<h3 ><b><i>Require GenAI use for certain tasks or assignments</i></b></h3>
<p ><i>Learning to use GenAI tools [such as ChatGPT or whichever the course requires….], and recognize their pluses and minuses, are important emerging skills. Students in this class will thus be required to use specific GenAI tools to complete certain assignments. Instructions and guidelines for required GenAI use will be provided in class, and we will thoroughly discuss and debrief our class engagement with GenAI.</i></p>

<h3 ><b><i>Allow open GenAI use but require proper citation of GenAI content</i></b></h3>
<p ><i>Students may use GenAI tools in this class to help with course work and assignments. Helpful uses include brainstorming ideas, creating outlines, editing, and so forth. However, if you include in your assignment submissions any content that is generated by GenAI, such as text, images, and graphics, you must cite the GenAI tool that is your source, in the same way that you must cite any content you use from other sources, such as books, articles, videos, the internet, etc. I will also provide helpful resources for how best to use GenAI to support your learning process and work. Although open use of GenAI is allowed in this class, be advised that GenAI suggestions or content can be inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise problematic; using GenAI can impact negatively the quality of your work and your grades.  I welcome questions and discussion about GenAI use in this course – let’s talk!</i></p>

<h3 ><b><i>Allow open GenAI use but require documentation of use and proper citation of GenAI content</i></b></h3>
<p ><i>Students can use GenAI tools in this class to help with course work and assignments.  Helpful uses include brainstorming ideas, creating outlines, editing, and so forth. If you use a GenAI tool, you need to document your use, including the tool you use and when, where, and how in your work process you used it. In certain cases, as part of your documentation, I may ask you to submit any GenAI results you obtained, so you need to keep GenAI-created drafts and logs of your interactions with GenAI tools; failure to provide such documentation may result in a grade reduction in certain instances. I will provide helpful resources for how best to use GenAI to support your learning process and work.</i></p>
<p ><i>Along with documentation of your GenAI use, you are also required to cite GenAI if you use any GenAI-created content in your work submissions — for example, text or images or graphics generated by GenAI tools. You need to treat GenAI just like other sources such as books, articles, videos, etc.  I will provide guidelines for how you need to cite GenAI tools as sources.  </i></p>

<h3 ><b><i>Allow certain GenAI uses but prohibit GenAI content</i></b></h3>
<p ><i>Students can use GenAI tools in this class to help with certain aspects of course work and assignments. This includes brainstorming ideas, creating a paper outline, or summarizing research findings of articles. However, you cannot use content such as text or graphics created by GenAI tools in your work; rather, you must be the author/creator of your work submissions. For example, you can use a GenAI tool to suggest a paper outline based on a draft you provide it, but you cannot submit a paper with text generated by GenAI as if the text is your own writing. If you are in doubt or have questions about a particular GenAI tool and if its use is okay, check in with me and let’s discuss!</i></p>

<h3 ><b><i>Allow GenAI use only with explicit permission for very specific tasks or assignments</i></b></h3>
<p ><i>Students may use GenAI tools in this course only with explicit instructor permission for certain tasks or on certain assignments. I will clearly indicate when you can use GenAI and provide clear guidelines for which GenAI tools are allowed and in what ways you can use them. I will also indicate how you will document your use of GenAI. The bottom line is, unless permission has been given, you should not use GenAI in this course. If in doubt, ask!</i></p>

<h3 ><b><i>Do not allow GenAI use or content</i></b></h3>
<p ><i>Students may not use GenAI tools in this course to produce course materials or assignments in whole or in part. All work you submit for this course toward completion of course requirements must be your own original work done specifically for this course and without substantive assistance from others, including GenAI. Work you’ve completed for previous courses or are developing for other courses this term also should not be submitted for this course. If you have any questions or doubts, please ask!</i></p>

  <!-- SAMPLE ACTIVITIES -->
  <div class="page" id="sample-activities">
    <div class="breadcrumb"><a href="#">Docs</a> / AI Toolkit / <a href="#sample-activities">Sample Activities</a></div>
    <h1>Sample Activities</h1>
    This page offers AI-related learning activities for instructors to adapt or reuse in their classes. These activities are designed to foster high-impact educational practices, from critical thinking and synthesis skills to peer learning and metacognition. If the goal is to prepare students to negotiate a world increasingly awash in AI tools and systems, then these activities offer a starting point for instructors here at CUNY.

Before proceeding, instructors should feel comfortable discussing basic AI terms and principles in addition to ethical problems raised by generative AI today. They should also feel confident with walking students through the process of leveraging these tools thoughtfully as part of the activities modeled below.

Instructors should also test these activities before they adapt its design and implement it in their courses. Conducting multiple dry-runs can go a long way toward effective instruction with a technology as dynamic and uncertain as AI. Practicing these activities also carries the added benefit of putting instructors in touch with recent updates to AI tools. Here it is key for instructors to question how these changes impact student learning, especially as AI tools begin to gain traction at CUNY and in education more broadly.
<h2>Revision and Peer Review</h2>
<h3>Student Drafts and AI Peer Review</h3>
In <a href="https://derekbruff.org/?p=4105">Assignment Makeovers in the AI Age</a>, Derek Bruff suggests an exercise in which students use an assignment rubric to evaluate and review the first draft of an assignment by a student volunteer in comparison to a mock draft generated by ChatGPT. Bruff explains further,
<p ><i>I would definitely share ChatGPT’s first draft with my students during class and have the students use the assignment rubric to evaluate it. I’ve often had a student volunteer to share a draft of their essay for peer evaluation using the rubric (</i><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/using-clickers-to-facilitate-peer-review-in-a-writing-seminar"><i>and a classroom response system</i></a><i>), but ChatGPT’s draft would be a better choice. None of the students would feel the need to hold back on harsh critiques out of fear of hurting the writer’s feelings! And this activity would lead to a very useful discussion about writing and my expectations for the assignment.</i></p>
This approach frames student participation through an evaluative lens and supports peer-to-peer learning without compromising learning objectives. It also encourages students to distinguish between the nuances of human writing and AI-generated content. Bruff’s activity is especially relevant for those who assign personal or reflective writing projects, such as literacy narratives or autoethnographies. Bonus points for instructors who can draw attention to the wonderful and diverse complexity of CUNY student writers, whose voices are likely to pop off the page compared to the uniform, if not homogenous language of an AI’s output.
<h4><b>Learning Goals</b></h4>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Comparative Analysis</strong>: Develop students' ability to critically evaluate writing using a rubric, distinguishing between human and AI-generated content.</li>
 	<li><strong>Critiquing AI in Writing</strong>: Gain insights into the characteristics and limitations of AI-generated writing compared to human expression.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reflection on Language Differences</strong>: Facilitate engagement with the value of cultural diversity and language differences in CUNY student writing</li>
</ol>
<i>Suggested tools: ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Claude 2</i>
<h2>Brainstorming and Invention</h2>
<h3>Post-It Note and AI Brainstorming</h3>
On an <a href="https://podcastindex.org/podcast/5769535">episode</a> of the Intentional Teaching podcast, Garrett Westlake offers an exercise in brainstorming that asks students to take down ideas for a project or assignment on Post-it notes, working within a specific time frame to produce as many brainstormed ideas as they can.

Concurrently, instructors use ChatGPT to generate additional ideas based on the same prompt. This dual approach allows the class to compare and contrast their ideas with those from ChatGPT, enriching the brainstorming process.

By integrating ChatGPT, instructors can extend the scope of brainstorming, uncovering overlapping and unique ideas. This comparison not only serves as a foundation for engaging discussions but also prompts students to reflect on and value the diverse knowledge and perspectives they contribute, highlighting the distinct insights human minds offer compared to artificial intelligence.
<h4><b>Learning Goals</b></h4>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Brainstorming Practice</strong>: Enhance ability to generate a wide range of ideas during brainstorming sessions</li>
 	<li><strong>Collaborative Learning</strong>: Develop capacity to brainstorm and select ideas in collaboration with peer learners</li>
 	<li><strong>AI-Assisted Ideation</strong>: Practice using AI text generators for the purpose of invention and brainstorming ideas</li>
</ol>
<i>Suggested Tools: ChatGPT, Claude 2, Bard, Bing Chat</i>
<h2>AI Literacy</h2>
<h3>Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT</h3>
Teaching students how to get the most out of generative AI models can be a daunting prospect for instructors. A starting point can be to review OpenAI’s <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/prompt-engineering">guide to prompt engineering</a>, which provides strategies and tactics often used to yield better results with ChatGPT. Strategies are broken into lists of tactics that scaffold users through the process of prompting ChatGPT with specific goals and techniques in mind.

OpenAI’s guide can be useful to instructors who feel that prompt engineering can or should be taught as an emergent research practice or compositional method. These strategies and tactics promote students’ functional awareness of ChatGPT and similar LLMs, while also providing clear and well-defined guidelines for how to engage intentionally with AI applications at large.
<h4><b>Learning Goals</b></h4>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>AI Tool Exploration</strong>: Develop the skill to explore and experiment with various features and functions of AI tools, understanding how different inputs can affect outputs.</li>
 	<li><strong>Effective Prompt Formulation</strong>: Learn to craft effective prompts that lead to desired outcomes, understanding the importance of specificity and clarity in communication with AI.</li>
 	<li><strong>Adapting to AI Responses</strong>: Students will gain the ability to adapt their prompts based on AI responses, refining their approach for improved interaction and results.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Compare and Contrast</h2>
When you distribute your syllabus to students, consider also distributing a version of the syllabus crafted by ChatGPT or another generative AI tool. Share the prompts you used to generate the syllabus with your students, and ask them to take five minutes to compare and contrast the two documents, jotting down whatever jumps out at them. Use the following questions to start a discussion:
<ul>
 	<li><em>How does each document imagine students in the class?</em></li>
 	<li><em>Where is there overlap in course content, and where is there divergence, and what might these instances suggest about how the class will approach the field of study? </em></li>
 	<li><em>What can you discern about the professor from each document? </em></li>
 	<li><em>What can you glean about the institution?</em></li>
</ul>
A cheekier approach to this exercise is to distribute the two documents without indicating which was created by generative AI, and asking your students to figure out which one. This approach is adaptable beyond the "syllabus day" moment in a course, and applicable to a variety of documents you might distribute, such as assignment prompts, primary sources, resource guides, and other readings.
<h4><b>Learning Goals</b></h4>
1. <strong>Critical Discernment:</strong> students will strengthen their capacity to evaluate and assess authorship, perspective, authenticity, and bias in texts.
2. <strong>Putting Disciplinary Learning in Context: </strong>students will gain experience thinking about how the curriculum for a course within a field takes shape, what choices are made, and why.

    <h1>Training Data</h1>
    <em><small>"Just as environmental impact scales with model size, so does the difficulty of understanding what is in the training data... large datasets based on texts from the Internet overrepresent hegemonic viewpoints and encode biases potentially damaging to marginalized populations. In collecting ever larger datasets we risk incurring documentation debt. We recommend mitigating these risks by budgeting for curation and documentation at the start of a project and only creating datasets as large as can be sufficiently documented."</small></em>

    <h1>Welcome to the Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit!</h1>
    In today's educational landscape, artificial intelligence is more than mere technology. It is also a subject that calls for critical engagement from students, faculty, and staff alike. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence automate the creation of content including text, images, music, and more. Scholars are now wrestling with profound methodological, pedagogical, ethical, and epistemological questions.

This toolkit offers guidelines and resources to help instructors support students as we all learn to navigate a world increasingly awash in AI. It also builds upon the work of colleagues at CUNY and elsewhere who have been closely following developments in artificial intelligence.

The toolkit opens below with critical provocations for instructors to pose to students. It then provides an FAQ on AI terms and concepts, followed by guidelines for how to approach questions of course policy and how to redesign assignments and activities with AI tools in mind. The toolkit then concludes with a resource hub containing links, articles, references, tools, and other relevant resources on AI’s role in education.
<h2>Provocations for CUNY Students <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span></h2>
As a starting point, instructors might pose the following provocations to their students to initiate critical dialogue on AI and its place in and beyond educational settings.
<ol>
 	<li><b> How much do students know about the history of artificial intelligence? </b></li>
</ol>
<p >AI history is marked by boom-and-bust periods that can inform how students understand recent advancements in AI technology and critically assess the ethical concerns that AI poses for the future.</p>

<ol start="2">
 	<li><b></b> <b>How much do students know about the role of human data in training AI?</b></li>
</ol>
<p >Students should understand that AI systems are trained using large datasets of human-generated text or image, and that the value systems embedded in these datasets directly influence how AI systems behave.</p>

<ol start="3">
 	<li><b> How much do students know about AI's inherent biases?</b></li>
</ol>
<p >AI systems can reproduce and amplify societal biases found in their training data, and students should be able to recognize and question these biases in AI’s representations of race, sex, gender, language, and culture.</p>

<ol start="4">
 	<li><b> How much do students know about AI’s lack of self-awareness?</b></li>
</ol>
<p >AI systems operate without understanding the meaning of their actions or the content they generate. Understanding this distinction is key for students to discern AI's capabilities and the need for human oversight.</p>

<ol start="5">
 	<li><b> How much do students know about the significance of their engagement with AI</b>?</li>
</ol>
<p >Students should understand that the framing they use to prompt generative AI influences the probability of yielding relevant and credible responses from these tools.</p>

<h2><strong>Toolkit Contents <span class="ttfmake-icon mceNonEditable fas"></span>
</strong></h2>
<a href="https://aitoolkit.commons.gc.cuny.edu/about-ai/"><b>About AI</b></a> surveys basic AI concepts and principles with a focus on recent advancements in generative AI technology, such as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and image generation tools like Midjourney.

<a href="https://aitoolkit.commons.gc.cuny.edu/course-policies/"><b>Course Policy </b></a>offers ethical guidelines and recommended policies for framing and deploying AI tools in educational settings. It provides reusable syllabus language for CUNY teachers and considers how self-advocacy and accountability can inform course policies on the use of generative AI tools in and outside the classroom.

<a href="https://aitoolkit.commons.gc.cuny.edu/assignment-makeovers/"><b>Assignment Makeovers</b></a> offers help with how to redesign assignments in ways that consider the wide availability of generative AI tools today. This includes suggestions for how to take an “activity inventory” of an assignment, and how to iteratively design that assignment with  process-based, visible learning in mind.

<a href="https://aitoolkit.commons.gc.cuny.edu/sample-activities/">Sample <strong>Activities</strong></a> surveys different kinds of AI-related activities for instructors to reuse in their classes. These activities are designed to foster critical thinking skills that prepare students to negotiate a world increasingly mediated by AI systems.
