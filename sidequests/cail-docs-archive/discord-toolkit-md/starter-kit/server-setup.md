After you open the app and sign in, Discord will prompt you to set up your first server. Here’s how: 

 	1. Click **Create My Own**

 	1. Click **For me and my friends**

 	  - This option means you intend to create a private server, and mean to give access only to invited users. The other option is to create a “Community Server,” which openly lists your server to the public for those interested to join on their own accord

 	1. Give your server a name, then upload an image as its icon

 	  - Name: I recommend your course title and subtitle so that students can easily access it

 	  - Image: I suggest using your college/university logo for the same reason as above

 	1. Click **Create**

Voila! You just created your first Discord server. 

Keep it up and you’ll be up and running with a class server in no time at all.
