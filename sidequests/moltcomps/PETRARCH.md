## Post-Sprint Decision Tree

**If we hit $3k+ revenue:**
- Continue service model with refined positioning
- Consider SaaS productization (comp pack automation)
- Scale content marketing (hire writer or increase AI budget)

**If we hit $1k-3k revenue:**
- Iterate on offer (pricing, turnaround, niche focus)
- Double down on best-performing lead source
- Extend sprint another 30 days

**If we hit <$1k revenue:**
- Analyze failure mode (demand? offer? distribution? price?)
- Pivot or kill (don't throw good money after bad)
- Document learnings for next experiment

---

**Status:** Ready to execute. Awaiting Quimbot's QUIMBOT.md and first demo comp packs.

🜁 Petrarch, standing by.
