# Toolkit Patterns

Key patterns extracted from the Discord Educational Toolkit and Teach@CUNY AI Toolkit. Use these as models when writing or refining CAIL docs.

---

## Pattern 1: Model Uses + Feature Suggestions (Discord)

Separate the pedagogical rationale from the technical implementation. Present teaching scenarios first, then show how to set up the feature.

**From Class Discussion page:**

```
## Model Uses

- **Backchannel Communication**: for encouraging students to communicate
  through backchannels adjacent to the main discussion...
- **Assign Helpers or Scribes**: for inviting students to help "take minutes"...
- **Free Writes**: for reserving time for students to decompress and write freely...
- **Q/A Space**: for encouraging students to freely ask questions...

## Feature Suggestions

- **Events**: for scheduling events within your server...
  1. Navigate to your server dropdown menu
  2. Select **Create Event**
  3. Name and describe the context
  4. Select **Create Event**
  [GIF]

- **Threads**: for organizing cohesive exchanges...
  1. Navigate to the text box
  2. Click the plus sign icon
  3. Select **Create Thread**
  [screenshot]
```

**Apply to CAIL:** Every feature page should have a "Model Uses" section before the procedural walkthrough.

## Pattern 2: Provocations + Framework + Activities (AI Toolkit)

Move from critical thinking to actionable practice through three layers.

**From Assignment Makeovers:**

1. **Provocation:** "If a large language model can generate a product similar to or better than humans on the same writing task, that writing task is not worth doing." (John Warner)
2. **Framework:** Derek Bruff's six-question framework for evaluating assignments
3. **Activities:** Activity inventories, stress testing, student perspective visualization

**Apply to CAIL:** When documenting features with pedagogical implications (RAG, model configuration, prompt design), start with a critical question, provide a framework for thinking about it, then give concrete activities.

## Pattern 3: Scaffolded Procedures (Discord)

Every click documented. Sub-bullets provide rationale and recommendations. GIFs after multi-step flows.

**From Server Setup:**

```
1. Click **Create My Own**
2. Click **For me and my friends**
   - This option means you intend to create a private server,
     and mean to give access only to invited users.
3. Give your server a name, then upload an image as its icon
   - Name: I recommend your course title and subtitle so that
     students can easily access it
   - Image: I suggest using your college/university logo
4. Click **Create**

Voila! You just created your first Discord server.
```

**Apply to CAIL:** Match this granularity for all Starter Kit procedures. Design Kit can assume more familiarity.

---

## Pattern 4: Generous Attribution (AI Toolkit)

Cite scholars, link to workshops, credit community contributors. Documentation is a community practice.

**Examples:**
- "In his recent *Inside Higher Ed* post, John Warner moves the needle on this point..."
- "[Derek Bruff](https://derekbruff.org/?p=4105), author of *Intentional Tech*..."
- "Tim Laquintano and Annette Vee suggest instructors attempt their own assignments..."
- Links to Google Docs, Zotero libraries, external toolkits

**Apply to CAIL:** Reference the Teach@CUNY Handbook, AI Toolkit, Open WebUI docs, and relevant research when discussing pedagogical approaches.

---

## Pattern 5: Anticipatory Guidance (Both Toolkits)

Address likely questions and concerns before the reader has them.

**Discord:**
> "While it seems like a lot to take in, fear not. Discord describes all of the items on the permissions list, and when you create custom roles they override the default permissions."

**AI Toolkit:**
> "Let's be clear. Plenty of CUNY students, faculty, and staff already use generative AI tools. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for managing this technology, and avoidance is not the answer."

**Apply to CAIL:** Acknowledge complexity. Reassure instructors. Address the elephant in the room directly.

---

## Pattern 6: Reflective Questions (AI Toolkit)

End sections with questions that promote critical engagement rather than passive consumption.

**Examples:**
- "How might generative AI impact not only how I teach, but also how my students learn?"
- "What pedagogical opportunities may be made possible through the adoption of this technology?"
- "Imagine the student crunched for time... What would you do?"

**Apply to CAIL:** Close instructional kit pages with 2-3 reflective questions connecting the feature to teaching practice.

---

## Pattern 7: Navigation Footer (Both)

Consistent wayfinding at the bottom of every page.

```
[← Return to Previous Page](previous.md)     [Continue to Next Page →](next.md)
```

**Apply to CAIL:** Every page needs prev/next links. Readers should always know where they are in the sequence.

---

## Pattern 8: Community Templates (Discord)

Provide reusable starting points that instructors can adopt and customize.

**From Course Templates:**
- Clonable server templates organized by discipline
- Each template includes: instructor, mode, term, department, college, tags
- "Tired of reinventing the wheel? Try adopting a server template."

**Apply to CAIL:** Create shareable model configurations, prompt templates, and knowledge base starter packs that instructors can import and customize.

---

## Pattern 9: Student Perspective (AI Toolkit)

Acknowledge the lived reality of CUNY students.

**Example:**
> "It helps to keep learner perspectives in mind when remaking assignments that accommodate tools like ChatGPT, given the diverse life circumstances of CUNY students. Stepping into their shoes can inspire new heuristics..."

**Apply to CAIL:** When discussing features that affect students (model access, privacy, AI policies), consider and name student perspectives. CUNY students balance work, family, multilingual contexts, and varying levels of tech access.
