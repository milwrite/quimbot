## Section Guidelines

### Title
Use descriptive titles that tell instructors what they will learn. Prefer action-oriented titles for procedural pages ("Creating Your First Model") and noun phrases for conceptual pages ("Knowledge Bases").

### Opening
One to two sentences. State what the page covers and why it matters to an instructor. No preamble.

### Model Uses
Separate the "why would I use this?" from the "how do I do it?" This is the pedagogical framing section. Each bullet should describe a real teaching scenario.

### Getting Started
The procedural core. Number every step. Use sub-bullets for rationale, recommendations, or caveats. Include visual placeholders after multi-step sequences.

### Going Deeper
Optional depth for users who want more control. This is where advanced configuration, edge cases, and power-user features live. Readers who stop at "Getting Started" should still be functional.

### Callout
One per page. Use for the single most important tip, warning, or best practice. Keep it short.

### Additional Resources
2-3 links to external resources. Prefer official documentation, research papers, and community guides. Include a one-line description of each.

### Navigation Footer
Every page links to the previous and next page in the kit sequence. This provides wayfinding and encourages sequential reading for newcomers.
