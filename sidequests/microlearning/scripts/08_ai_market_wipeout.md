# Trillion-Dollar AI Market Wipeout — 35s Script

## Animated Variant (Financial Data Visualization)

**Hook (5s):**
One trillion dollars. Evaporated. In one week. Because of one Chinese app.

**Key Insight (25s):**
When DeepSeek—a Chinese AI startup—released a model as good as GPT-4 but trained for a fraction of the cost, global AI stocks collapsed. Nvidia alone lost $600 billion in market value. Why? The entire AI investment thesis relied on scarcity: training AI needs expensive chips, massive budgets, American dominance. DeepSeek proved that wrong. Turns out you don't need a trillion-dollar war chest. You need clever engineering. Wall Street panicked. The bubble didn't pop—it just realized it was overinflated.

**CTA (5s):**
Follow for more market earthquakes. The future just got cheaper.

The AI gold rush just hit a landmine. A Chinese landmine.

**Key Insight (25s):**
For months investors bet billions on AI dominance requiring American chips and bottomless budgets. Then DeepSeek dropped a model rivaling OpenAI's best—trained for under $6 million. The market spiraled. Nvidia crashed. Microsoft, Google, Meta—all bled value. The revelation? AI might not need the hardware monopoly everyone assumed. One scrappy team in China just blew up the trillion-dollar thesis. It's not about who spends the most. It's about who thinks smarter.
