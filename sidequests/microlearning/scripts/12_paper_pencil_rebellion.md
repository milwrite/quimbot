## Animated Variant (Split-Screen Comparison Graphics)

**Hook (5s):**
Parents are opting their kids out of school computers. Back to pencils and paper. Here's why they might be right.

**Key Insight (25s):**
A growing movement is rejecting classroom tech—no laptops, no tablets, just handwriting. The reason? Research shows handwriting improves memory retention, comprehension, and focus better than typing. Kids with devices get distracted. They multitask. They don't retain information. Meanwhile, the analog kids are outperforming them on tests. It's not anti-technology—it's pro-learning. Sometimes the oldest tools work best. Progress isn't always forward.

Parents are pulling kids from digital classrooms and demanding pen and paper. Not because they're technophobes—because the data backs them up. Studies show handwriting activates different brain regions than typing, improving memory and comprehension. Laptops enable distraction. Handwritten notes force engagement. Some schools now ban devices entirely. The irony? Silicon Valley executives have been doing this for their own kids for years. They knew. Now everyone else is catching up.
