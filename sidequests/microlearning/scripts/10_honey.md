## Script

**HOOK (0-3s):**
This food is three thousand years old and you could still eat it for breakfast.

**SETUP (3-15s):**
Archaeologists digging through ancient Egyptian tombs found jars of honey sealed thousands of years ago. When they opened them? The honey was still perfectly preserved—golden, sweet, and edible.

**POINT_1 (15-27s):**
Honey never spoils because of its weird chemistry. It's extremely low in moisture and highly acidic. That creates an environment where bacteria and microorganisms just can't survive.

**POINT_2 (27-42s):**
When bees make honey they add an enzyme that produces hydrogen peroxide—a natural antimicrobial agent. The thick consistency also stops oxygen from getting in, which prevents decomposition.

**POINT_3 (42-52s):**
As long as it's sealed properly honey can last indefinitely. The oldest known sample is over five thousand years old from Georgia. Still intact.

**CONCLUSION (52-57s):**
Honey is one of the few foods that's genuinely immortal.
