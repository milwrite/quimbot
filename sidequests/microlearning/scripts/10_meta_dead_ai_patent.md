# Meta's Dead Person AI Patent — 35s Script

## Animated Variant (Sci-Fi Concept Visualization)

**Hook (5s):**
Meta just patented AI that takes over your account after you die. Here's the part everyone's missing.

**Key Insight (25s):**
The patent describes AI trained on your posts, messages, and behavior—continuing to post as "you" after death. Creepy? Absolutely. But here's the key: **patents aren't products**. Companies patent thousands of ideas they never build. It's legal territory-claiming, not a roadmap. The real microlearning nugget? Understanding patent ≠ plan. That said, the fact they even *thought* to patent digital necromancy reveals where their minds are. And that's worth examining.

**CTA (5s):**
Follow for tech ethics that'll haunt you. Would you want this?

## Documentary Variant (Tech Ethics Investigation)

**Hook (5s):**
Your grandmother's Facebook. Still posting. Years after she died. Because AI learned how.

**Key Insight (25s):**
Meta filed a patent for AI that impersonates deceased users—posting, messaging, "living" digitally forever. Before you panic: **patents aren't promises**. Tech giants file thousands annually to block competitors, not to build products. But intention matters less than possibility. The fact this tech is even conceivable—and legally protected—opens ethical abysses. Who consents? Who profits? Who mourns a chatbot? The patent might gather dust. The questions won't.

**CTA (5s):**
More tech that crosses lines you didn't know existed. Follow now.
