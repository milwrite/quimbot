# Mantis Shrimp Vision — 60s Script

**Hook (3s):**
This shrimp can see colors you can't even imagine... but it's terrible at telling them apart.

**Setup (12s):**
Mantis shrimp have sixteen color receptors in their eyes. Humans only have three. You'd think that means they see the world in incredible detail, right? Wrong.

**Point 1 (10s):**
Scientists tested them and found something bizarre: despite having way more color sensors, mantis shrimp are actually worse at distinguishing between similar shades than we are.

**Point 2 (10s):**
Why? Their brains don't process color the same way. Instead of blending signals like ours do, each receptor works independently—like having sixteen separate cameras but no editor.

**Point 3 (10s):**
What they DO excel at? Speed. They can identify threats and prey in milliseconds—faster than any predator on Earth. It's not about seeing better. It's about seeing faster.

**Conclusion (10s):**
So mantis shrimp traded color accuracy for reaction time. More isn't always better—sometimes it's just different. Evolution optimizes for survival, not art appreciation.

**CTA (5s):**
Follow for more ocean science that'll flip your assumptions. What other "superpowers" might not work the way you think?
