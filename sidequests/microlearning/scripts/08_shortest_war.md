## Script

**HOOK (0-3s):**
This war lasted thirty-eight minutes. One side had a wooden boat. The other had the British Empire.

**SETUP (3-15s):**
In 1896, the Sultan of Zanzibar died. His nephew seized power without British approval. Big mistake. Britain had other plans and issued an ultimatum: step down or face consequences.

**POINT_1 (15-27s):**
The new Sultan refused and barricaded himself in the palace with about three thousand defenders and one ceremonial wooden boat he called his navy.

**POINT_2 (27-42s):**
Britain responded by parking five warships in the harbor. At nine-oh-two AM on August 27th, they opened fire. The palace was obliterated. By nine-forty, it was over.

**POINT_3 (42-52s):**
Casualty count: roughly five hundred on Zanzibar's side, one British sailor injured. The wooden boat sank immediately.

**CONCLUSION (52-57s):**
The shortest war in recorded history. Not even long enough for lunch.

**CTA (57-60s):**
