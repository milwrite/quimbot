# AI Hard Drive Apocalypse — 30s Script

## Animated Variant (Infographic Motion Graphics)

**Hook (5s):**
AI just bought every hard drive on Earth. For an entire year.

**Key Insight (20s):**
Data centers training AI models consumed so many high-capacity drives that manufacturers sold out their entire 2024 production—before the year even started. Not just low stock. Completely. Gone. Why? Training one large language model requires petabytes of storage. Multiply that by every tech company racing to build the next ChatGPT, and you get a global hardware shortage. AI isn't just using the internet—it's eating the physical infrastructure underneath it.

## Documentary Variant (Tech Industry Exposé Style)

**Hook (5s):**
Every hard drive. Gone. For twelve months. Because of AI.

**Key Insight (20s):**
In 2024, manufacturers ran out of high-capacity hard drives—the entire year's production sold before January ended. The culprit? AI data centers hoarding storage for model training. Each AI model needs petabytes of space. Each tech giant needs multiple models. The math becomes impossible. This is the hidden cost of the AI boom: physical scarcity. Silicon, power, cooling, now storage. The cloud isn't made of air—it's made of metal, and we're running out.

**CTA (5s):**
More hidden infrastructure crises. Follow before the lights go out.
