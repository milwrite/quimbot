# UK's Social Media Accountability Law — 30s Script

## Animated Variant (Legislative Process Motion Graphics)

**Hook (5s):**
The UK just made social media CEOs personally liable. Prison time. For your tweets.

**Key Insight (20s):**
New laws put tech executives—not just companies—on the hook for harmful content. Fail to remove illegal stuff? The CEO can face jail. It's a massive shift: platforms treated like publishers, not neutral hosts. The goal? Force real moderation. The risk? Over-censorship and chilling effects. Silicon Valley is watching nervously. If it works in the UK other countries will copy it. The era of "we're just a platform" might be ending.

**CTA (5s):**
Follow for more tech policy that rewrites the internet. Thoughts?

## Documentary Variant (Policy Documentary Style)

**Hook (5s):**
Social media broke democracy. Now the UK is breaking social media back.

**Key Insight (20s):**
New British laws hold executives—not corporations—personally responsible for platform harm. CEOs can go to prison for failing to remove illegal content quickly enough. It's a radical departure: tech leaders treated like newspaper editors, legally liable for what users post. Critics warn of censorship. Supporters say accountability is overdue. Either way the internet's Wild West era is ending. When one major democracy rewrites the rules others follow.

**CTA (5s):**
More regulation battles reshaping tech. Follow before the rules change.
