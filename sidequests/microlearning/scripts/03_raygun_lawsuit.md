**Key Insight (20s):**
When Australian breakdancer Raygun bombed at the Olympics the internet responded with ruthless memes. But when scholars published research examining what went wrong, her team threatened legal action. Not for lies—for studying a public Olympic performance. The case shows a modern tension: public figures want attention until that attention includes critical analysis. Science doesn't require permission. That's the whole point.
