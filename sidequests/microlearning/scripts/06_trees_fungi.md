## Script

**HOOK (0-3s):**
Trees are texting each other right now. Underground. Through mushrooms.

**SETUP (3-15s):**
Forests aren't just collections of individual trees—they're interconnected superorganisms. Beneath your feet, an invisible network of fungal threads connects tree roots in what scientists call the mycorrhizal network.

**POINT_1 (15-27s):**
Trees use this network to share resources. A large mother tree can send nutrients to struggling saplings through the fungal highway, keeping them alive even in deep shade.

**POINT_2 (27-42s):**
But they also send warnings. When a tree is attacked by insects, it releases chemical signals through the network, alerting neighboring trees to boost their defenses before the pests arrive.

**POINT_3 (42-52s):**
Some scientists call it the "wood wide web." The fungi act as biological internet cables, transferring information and resources across the entire forest.

**CONCLUSION (52-57s):**
Forests aren't just alive—they're intelligent, communicating ecosystems we're only beginning to understand.

**CTA (57-60s):**
