## Script

**HOOK (0-3s):**
This creature can survive in outer space, endure extreme radiation, and come back from the dead. It's smaller than a grain of sand.

**SETUP (3-15s):**
Meet the tardigrade, also called a water bear. This microscopic animal is the toughest living thing on Earth, and possibly the entire universe.

**POINT_1 (15-27s):**
Tardigrades can survive temperatures from near absolute zero to over three hundred degrees Fahrenheit. They've been frozen for thirty years, thawed out, and walked away like nothing happened.

**POINT_2 (27-42s):**
They can withstand radiation levels a thousand times higher than humans. In 2007, scientists sent them to space. Exposed to the vacuum and cosmic rays, most survived and even reproduced afterward.

**POINT_3 (42-52s):**
How? They enter a state called cryptobiosis, essentially shutting down all metabolic processes and becoming nearly indestructible.

**CONCLUSION (52-57s):**
When Earth is gone, tardigrades will likely still be here, waiting for the next planet.

**CTA (57-60s):**
Follow for more bizarre science.
