## Script

**HOOK (0-3s):**
This thing can survive in outer space, endure extreme radiation, and come back from the dead. It's smaller than a grain of sand.

**SETUP (3-15s):**
Meet the tardigrade. Also called a water bear. This microscopic animal is the toughest living thing on Earth. Possibly in the entire universe.

**POINT_1 (15-27s):**
Tardigrades can handle temperatures from near absolute zero to over three hundred degrees Fahrenheit. They've been frozen for thirty years, thawed out, and just walked away like nothing happened.

**POINT_2 (27-42s):**
They can withstand radiation levels a thousand times higher than what would kill us. In 2007 scientists sent them to space. Exposed to the vacuum and cosmic rays, most survived. Some even reproduced afterward.

**POINT_3 (42-52s):**
How? They enter something called cryptobiosis. Basically shutting down all metabolic processes and becoming nearly indestructible.

**CONCLUSION (52-57s):**
When Earth is gone, tardigrades will probably still be here, waiting for the next planet.

**CTA (57-60s):**
Follow for more bizarre science.
