# Are We Getting Dumber? Flynn Effect Reversal — 35s Script

## Animated Variant (Abstract Data Visualization)

**Hook (5s):**
For 100 years, IQ scores went up. Now they're going down. What changed?

**Key Insight (25s):**
The Flynn Effect was one of psychology's most consistent findings: every generation scored higher on IQ tests than the last. Better nutrition, education, healthcare—humanity was getting smarter. Until the 1990s. Now, in developed nations, scores are dropping. Norway, Denmark, France—all seeing declines. Why? No one's sure. Worse diets? Screen time? Education changes? Environmental toxins? The reversal is real, but the cause is still a mystery. We might be living through peak human intelligence right now.

## Documentary Variant (Scientific Investigation Style)

**Hook (5s):**
Every generation got smarter than the last. Until now.

**Key Insight (25s):**
For a century, IQ scores climbed steadily—the Flynn Effect. Then, in the 1990s, something broke. Scores started falling in developed countries. Not everywhere, not all tests, but enough to worry researchers. Better schools didn't stop it. Wealth didn't prevent it. The decline is real, measured, and unexplained. Theories range from nutrition to screen addiction to microplastics. But here's the terrifying part: we don't know which, and we're not slowing down to find out.

More science that should scare you. Follow now.
