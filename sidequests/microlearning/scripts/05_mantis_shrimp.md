## Script

**HOOK (0-3s):**
This shrimp can see colors you can't even imagine. But it's terrible at telling them apart.

**SETUP (3-15s):**
The mantis shrimp has sixteen color receptors in its eyes. Humans have only three. You'd think that means they see way more colors than we do, right? Wrong.

**POINT_1 (15-27s):**
Scientists tested them and discovered mantis shrimp are actually worse at distinguishing between similar colors than we are. They can detect more wavelengths but can't process the subtle differences.

**POINT_2 (27-42s):**
So why have sixteen receptors? Speed. Instead of blending colors like our brains do, mantis shrimp recognize colors instantly without processing. They sacrifice precision for reaction time.

**POINT_3 (42-52s):**
This makes sense when you realize they're ambush predators with the fastest punch in the animal kingdom. They need to identify prey and strike in milliseconds.

**CONCLUSION (52-57s):**
More sensors doesn't always mean better vision—it means different priorities.

**CTA (57-60s):**
Follow for more ocean mysteries.
