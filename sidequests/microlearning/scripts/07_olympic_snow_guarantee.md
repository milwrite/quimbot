# How Olympics Guarantee Snow — 30s Script

## Animated Variant (Explainer Motion Graphics)

**Hook (5s):**
The Winter Olympics always have perfect snow. Even when it's 60 degrees. Here's how.

**Key Insight (20s):**
Snow cannons. Industrial-scale snow cannons that can blanket entire mountains in artificial powder. They spray a fine mist of water into cold air—doesn't need to be freezing on the ground, just in the air above. Some recent Olympics like Beijing 2022 were 100% artificial snow. Zero natural flakes. And athletes can tell the difference—it's icier, faster, less forgiving. But it guarantees the games happen no matter what Mother Nature does.

## Documentary Variant (Behind-the-Scenes Tech Documentary)

**Hook (5s):**
Climate change versus the Winter Olympics. Technology is winning. For now.

**Key Insight (20s):**
Massive snow cannons, miles of pipes, industrial refrigeration—modern Olympics engineer their own winter. Even when temps hit 60°F they're making snow. How? High-pressure water mist meets cold air. Doesn't matter if the ground is warm. Beijing 2022 used only artificial snow across every venue—a first in Olympic history. Athletes hate it. It's harder, icier, more dangerous. But it's reliable. Nature isn't anymore.

**CTA (5s):**
More tech versus climate battles. Follow before winter disappears.
