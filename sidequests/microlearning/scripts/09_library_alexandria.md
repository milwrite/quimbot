## Script

**HOOK (0-3s):**
The Library of Alexandria didn't burn down in one dramatic fire. It was defunded to death.

**SETUP (3-15s):**
We imagine the ancient world's greatest library consumed in flames, all that knowledge lost in a single catastrophic night. The reality is far more tragic and familiar.

**POINT_1 (15-27s):**
The library declined over centuries due to budget cuts, political instability, and neglect. Fewer scholars meant fewer acquisitions. Maintenance stopped. Scrolls crumbled from moisture and pests.

**POINT_2 (27-42s):**
There were fires—several small ones over hundreds of years. But the real killer was indifference. Each generation cared a little less until one day, there was nothing left worth protecting.

**POINT_3 (42-52s):**
The last recorded mention of scholars working there was in the third century CE. After that, silence. The library didn't explode—it faded.

**CONCLUSION (52-57s):**
Great institutions don't always end with spectacle. Sometimes they just... stop.

**CTA (57-60s):**
Follow for more real history.
