## Script

**HOOK (0-3s):**
Octopuses can rewrite their own genetic code in real time. Humans can't do this.

**SETUP (3-15s):**
Most animals, including us, are locked into the DNA we're born with. But octopuses have a superpower: they can edit their RNA, the messenger molecule that translates DNA into proteins.

**POINT_1 (15-27s):**
This means they can adapt to changing environments almost instantly. Moving from warm water to cold? An octopus can edit its nerve cell proteins on the fly to maintain function.

**POINT_2 (27-42s):**
Scientists discovered that octopuses edit their RNA at rates tens of thousands of times higher than humans. They're constantly rewriting their biology to suit their needs.

**POINT_3 (42-52s):**
The tradeoff? This ability comes at a cost. Octopuses have sacrificed traditional DNA evolution, which is why they haven't changed much in millions of years.

**CONCLUSION (52-57s):**
They chose adaptation over evolution—a fundamentally alien approach to survival.
