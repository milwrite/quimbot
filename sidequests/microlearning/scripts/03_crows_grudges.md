## Script

**HOOK (0-3s):**
Mess with a crow once, and it will remember your face forever. So will its children.

**SETUP (3-15s):**
Scientists at the University of Washington discovered something terrifying: crows can recognize individual human faces, remember who wronged them, and hold grudges for years.

**POINT_1 (15-27s):**
In experiments, researchers wore masks while trapping and tagging crows. Years later, those same crows would dive-bomb anyone wearing that specific mask—even though they'd never been trapped by that person.

**POINT_2 (27-42s):**
Even more disturbing: crows teach their offspring to hate the same people. Young crows who were never trapped themselves learned to attack the masked researchers just by watching their parents.

**POINT_3 (42-52s):**
This means crows have cultural memory. They pass down knowledge of threats across generations, creating vendetta lineages that can last decades.

**CONCLUSION (52-57s):**
So if you've ever wronged a crow, its grandchildren are plotting revenge right now.

**CTA (57-60s):**
