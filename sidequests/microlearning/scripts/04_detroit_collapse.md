# Detroit's Population Death Spiral — 40s Script

## Animated Variant (Abstract Data Visualization)

**Hook (5s):**
The only American city to hit one million people... then fall back below it. Here's the loop that killed it.

**Key Insight (30s):**
Detroit's collapse wasn't random—it was a mechanism. Step one: factories close, jobs disappear. Step two: workers leave, tax revenue drops. Step three: city cuts services—police, schools, streetlights. Step four: more people flee the decay. Step five: tax base shrinks further. Repeat. This isn't just Detroit's story—it's the blueprint for urban death spirals everywhere. From 1.8 million to 600,000 in sixty years. The math is brutal: once the loop starts, it feeds itself.

**CTA (5s):**
Follow for more systems that devour themselves. Which city is next?

## Documentary Variant (Archival Footage + Drone B-roll)

**Hook (5s):**
1.8 million people. Then 600,000. What happened?

**Key Insight (30s):**
Detroit didn't just decline—it collapsed in a perfect storm of feedback loops. Jobs left. People followed. Tax revenue vanished. Services deteriorated. More people left. Repeat. By 2013, the city was bankrupt. Entire neighborhoods returned to prairie. Streetlights went dark. Schools closed. It's the only major American city to ever peak above one million, then crash below it. The lesson? Cities aren't permanent. They're systems. And systems can fail catastrophically when the wrong dominoes start falling.
