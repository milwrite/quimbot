## Script

**HOOK (0-3s):**
Cleopatra never saw the pyramids being built. Want to know why?

**SETUP (3-15s):**
We think of ancient Egypt as one continuous era, but the timeline is more shocking than you realize. The Great Pyramid was already ancient history when Cleopatra ruled Egypt.

**POINT_1 (15-25s):**
The Great Pyramid was built around 2560 BCE. That's over four thousand five hundred years ago.

**POINT_2 (25-35s):**
Cleopatra ruled Egypt from 51 to 30 BCE. That's roughly two thousand years AFTER the pyramids were finished.

**POINT_3 (35-50s):**
The iPhone was released in 2007 CE. That's only two thousand thirty-seven years after Cleopatra's death. She's actually closer to your smartphone than to the ancient monuments she lived beside.

**CONCLUSION (50-57s):**
History isn't a straight line. Cleopatra gazed at the pyramids the same way we look at Roman ruins—as mysterious relics from an impossibly distant past.

**CTA (57-60s):**
