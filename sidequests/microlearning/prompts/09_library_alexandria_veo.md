**Total Scenes:** 6 + branded outro  
**Estimated Veo Cost:** $3.60 (6 scenes × $0.60)

---

## Scene 1: Hook (3 seconds)
**Script:** "The Library of Alexandria didn't burn down in one dramatic fire. It was defunded to death."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Split-screen visual: left side shows dramatic flames consuming scrolls (the myth), right side shows dusty, empty shelves in dim abandoned hall (the reality). Stark contrast between myth and truth, cinematic lighting, 4K quality, 3 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Myth vs. reality contrast

---

## Scene 2: Setup (12 seconds)
**Script:** "We imagine the ancient world's greatest library consumed in flames, all that knowledge lost in a single catastrophic night. The reality is far more tragic and familiar."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Majestic interior of the Library of Alexandria at its peak: towering shelves filled with papyrus scrolls, scholars reading at tables, sunlight streaming through tall columns. Golden hour lighting, dust particles floating in light beams, grand and awe-inspiring, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Library in its glory days

---

## Scene 3: Point 1 (12 seconds)
**Script:** "The library declined over centuries due to budget cuts, political instability, and neglect. Fewer scholars meant fewer acquisitions. Maintenance stopped. Scrolls crumbled from moisture and pests."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Time-lapse of the same library interior degrading: scholars disappearing, scrolls becoming fewer, dust accumulating, shelves emptying, columns cracking. Subtle decay over time, melancholic atmosphere, fading light, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Slow institutional decay

---

## Scene 4: Point 2 (15 seconds)
**Script:** "There were fires—several small ones over hundreds of years. But the real killer was indifference. Each generation cared a little less until one day, there was nothing left worth protecting."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Sequence of small fires in different sections over time, each less severe than imagined. Between fires, neglect: scrolls molding, insects eating papyrus, rain leaking through damaged roof. Each generation passing by with less interest. Tragic progression, documentary realism, 4K quality, 15 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Accumulated neglect worse than fire

---

## Scene 5: Point 3 (10 seconds)
**Script:** "The last recorded mention of scholars working there was in the third century CE. After that, silence. The library didn't explode—it faded."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Close-up of an ancient manuscript page, ink fading and crumbling to dust in someone's hands. Wider shot reveals empty, abandoned library hall with broken columns and scattered fragments. Silence and stillness, melancholic mood, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Final abandonment, quiet ending

---

## Scene 6: Conclusion (5 seconds)
**Script:** "Great institutions don't always end with spectacle. Sometimes they just... stop."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Slow zoom out from the ruins of ancient Alexandria, overgrown with vegetation, barely recognizable. Modern city visible in background, life continuing. Reflective, philosophical mood, subtle fade to black, 4K quality, 5 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Passage of time, quiet reflection

---

## Scene 7: CTA (3 seconds)
**Format:** Branded outro card (not Veo-generated)

**Design:**
- Text: "Follow for more real history"
- Background: Ancient scroll with faded text
- Logo: Channel branding
