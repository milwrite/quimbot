## Scene 1: Hook (3 seconds)
**Script:** "This war lasted thirty-eight minutes. One side had a wooden boat. The other had the British Empire."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Wide shot of Zanzibar harbor in 1896, single small wooden ceremonial boat visible in foreground. Background shows five massive British warships arriving, ominous and overwhelming. Sepia-toned vintage photography style, dramatic contrast in scale, 4K quality, 3 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** David vs. Goliath absurdity

---

## Scene 2: Setup (12 seconds)
**Script:** "In 1896, the Sultan of Zanzibar died. His nephew seized power without British approval. Big mistake. Britain had other plans and issued an ultimatum: step down or face consequences."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Tracking shot through ornate Sultan's palace interior, 1890s Zanzibar. Rich fabrics, carved wooden doors, tropical colonial architecture. Tension in the air, advisors whispering urgently. Dramatic lighting through window shutters, vintage film grain, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Palace intrigue, rising tension

---

## Scene 3: Point 1 (12 seconds)
**Script:** "The new Sultan refused and barricaded himself in the palace with about three thousand defenders and one ceremonial wooden boat he called his navy."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Montage of palace defenders taking positions: soldiers with outdated rifles on balconies, wooden barricades being erected. Cut to the ceremonial wooden boat (HHS Glasgow) being positioned near shore, absurdly small and ornamental. Tense but comedic undertones, vintage newsreel style, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Desperate preparations, absurd "navy"

---

## Scene 4: Point 2 (15 seconds)
**Script:** "Britain responded by parking five warships in the harbor. At nine-oh-two AM on August 27th, they opened fire. The palace was obliterated. By nine-forty, it was over."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Dramatic sequence: British warships fire cannons in unison, muzzle flashes and smoke. Palace walls explode in slow motion, debris flying. Cut to pocket watch showing time passing: 9:02 AM → 9:40 AM. Vintage war documentary style with modern cinematic slow-motion, 4K quality, 15 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Overwhelming firepower, rapid destruction

---

## Scene 5: Point 3 (10 seconds)
**Script:** "Casualty count: roughly five hundred on Zanzibar's side, one British sailor injured. The wooden boat sank immediately."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Shot of the ceremonial wooden boat sinking into the harbor, tilting and disappearing beneath the waves. Smoke rising from the destroyed palace in background. Melancholic piano music vibe, tragic but absurd, vintage sepia tone, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Symbolic defeat—boat sinking

---

## Scene 6: Conclusion (5 seconds)
**Script:** "The shortest war in recorded history. Not even long enough for lunch."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Aerial view of Zanzibar harbor after the battle: palace smoldering, British ships still anchored, calm returning. Overlay: clock graphic showing 38 minutes elapsed. Reflective, almost comedic ending, vintage photograph aesthetic, 4K quality, 5 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Aftermath, time elapsed visualization
