# Veo Prompts: Trees Can "Talk" via Fungal Networks

**Video Title:** Trees Can "Talk" via Fungal Networks  
**Total Scenes:** 6 + branded outro  
**Estimated Veo Cost:** $3.60 (6 scenes × $0.60)

---

## Scene 1: Hook (3 seconds)
**Script:** "Trees are texting each other right now. Underground. Through mushrooms."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Underground cross-section view showing tree roots intertwined with glowing bioluminescent fungal threads. Light pulses travel through the network like data packets. Dark soil background with ethereal blue-green glow, mystical atmosphere, 4K quality, 3 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Hidden network revealed, visual metaphor

---

## Scene 2: Setup (12 seconds)
**Script:** "Forests aren't just collections of individual trees—they're interconnected superorganisms. Beneath your feet, an invisible network of fungal threads connects tree roots in what scientists call the mycorrhizal network."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Cinematic aerial shot of dense forest canopy, slowly zooming down through the soil layers. Transition to underground view revealing vast network of white fungal threads (mycorrhizae) connecting multiple tree root systems. Scientific documentary style with CGI enhancement, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Perspective shift from above to below ground

---

## Scene 3: Point 1 (12 seconds)
**Script:** "Trees use this network to share resources. A large mother tree can send nutrients to struggling saplings through the fungal highway, keeping them alive even in deep shade."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Animated visualization showing glowing nutrients flowing from large tree roots through fungal network to small sapling roots. Time-lapse effect of sapling growing healthier as nutrients arrive. Bioluminescent glow effect, warm golden light representing life transfer, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Nutrient transfer as visual narrative

---

## Scene 4: Point 2 (15 seconds)
**Script:** "But they also send warnings. When a tree is attacked by insects, it releases chemical signals through the network, alerting neighboring trees to boost their defenses before the pests arrive."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Split visualization: top shows insects attacking tree leaves above ground. Bottom shows chemical warning signals (visualized as red pulses) spreading rapidly through the underground fungal network to neighboring trees. Trees receiving signal begin producing defensive compounds (shown as protective shields). Urgent, dynamic motion, 4K quality, 15 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Warning system activation, defense response

---

## Scene 5: Point 3 (10 seconds)
**Script:** "Some scientists call it the 'wood wide web.' The fungi act as biological internet cables, transferring information and resources across the entire forest."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Wide underground network visualization resembling internet fiber optic cables, but organic. Glowing fungal threads pulse with activity, nodes at each tree connection point. Data visualization aesthetic meets biological reality, futuristic but natural, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** "Wood wide web" metaphor visualized

---

## Scene 6: Conclusion (5 seconds)
**Script:** "Forests aren't just alive—they're intelligent, communicating ecosystems we're only beginning to understand."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Slow zoom out from underground network back to peaceful forest above ground. Sunlight filtering through canopy, serene and majestic. Sense of hidden complexity beneath simple beauty. Reflective, awe-inspiring mood, 4K quality, 5 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Return to surface, newfound appreciation

---

## Scene 7: CTA (3 seconds)
**Format:** Branded outro card (not Veo-generated)

**Design:**
- Text: "Follow for more nature secrets"
- Background: Forest floor with glowing fungal network pattern
- Logo: Channel branding
