## Scene 1: Hook (3 seconds)
**Script:** "Cleopatra never saw the pyramids being built. Want to know why?"

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Slow zoom into the Great Pyramid of Giza at sunset, golden light casting long shadows across the desert. A silhouette of Cleopatra in royal Egyptian headdress stands in the foreground, gazing up at the monument. Cinematic, mysterious atmosphere, 4K quality, 3 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Establishing shot with dramatic scale contrast

---

## Scene 2: Setup (12 seconds)
**Script:** "We think of ancient Egypt as one continuous era, but the timeline is more shocking than you realize. The Great Pyramid was already ancient history when Cleopatra ruled Egypt."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Aerial drone shot flying over the Egyptian desert landscape, transitioning from the pyramids of Giza to ancient Alexandria with its lighthouse and harbor. Golden hour lighting, dust particles in the air, cinematic pan across time and space, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Geographic and temporal transition

---

## Scene 3: Point 1 (10 seconds)
**Script:** "The Great Pyramid was built around 2560 BCE. That's over four thousand five hundred years ago."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Close-up tracking shot of ancient Egyptian workers hauling massive limestone blocks up wooden ramps. Dust swirling, sweat glistening, thousands of workers coordinated in motion. Dramatic overhead sun, epic scale, realistic historical detail, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Pyramid construction in progress

---

## Scene 4: Point 2 (10 seconds)
**Script:** "Cleopatra ruled Egypt from 51 to 30 BCE. That's roughly two thousand years AFTER the pyramids were finished."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Elegant tracking shot through Cleopatra's palace in Alexandria. Ornate golden columns, silk curtains billowing, sunlight streaming through open windows. Cleopatra (not visible, implied presence) with scrolls and advisors in background. Opulent, regal atmosphere, cinematic lighting, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Cleopatra's era—wealth and sophistication

---

## Scene 5: Point 3 (15 seconds)
**Script:** "The iPhone was released in 2007 CE. That's only two thousand thirty-seven years after Cleopatra's death. She's actually closer to your smartphone than to the ancient monuments she lived beside."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Split-screen timeline visualization. Left side: ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs carved in stone, slowly transitioning to Cleopatra's era with papyrus scrolls. Right side: modern iPhone rotating on a marble pedestal, sleek and minimalist. Center: animated timeline with dates appearing (2560 BCE → 30 BCE → 2007 CE). Cinematic transition, dramatic reveal, 4K quality, 15 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Timeline comparison with visual contrast

## Scene 6: Conclusion (7 seconds)
**Script:** "History isn't a straight line. Cleopatra gazed at the pyramids the same way we look at Roman ruins—as mysterious relics from an impossibly distant past."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Slow zoom out from the Great Pyramid at dusk, stars beginning to appear in the sky. The pyramid transitions from freshly built (smooth limestone casing) to weathered and ancient. Time-lapse effect showing centuries passing. Melancholic, reflective mood, cinematic quality, 4K, 7 seconds.
```
