---

## Scene 1: Hook (3 seconds)
**Script:** "Mess with a crow once, and it will remember your face forever. So will its children."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Extreme close-up of a crow's eye staring directly at the camera, unblinking and intense. Reflection of a human face visible in the eye. Dark, unsettling atmosphere, shallow depth of field, cinematic thriller vibe, 4K quality, 3 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Intense, direct confrontation

---

## Scene 2: Setup (12 seconds)
**Script:** "Scientists at the University of Washington discovered something terrifying: crows can recognize individual human faces, remember who wronged them, and hold grudges for years."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Wide shot of a university research campus with trees full of crows watching from the branches. Researchers walking below, looking up nervously. Crows tracking their movement with head tilts. Overcast day, ominous mood, cinematic documentary style, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Crows as observers, humans as subjects

---

## Scene 3: Point 1 (12 seconds)
**Script:** "In experiments, researchers wore masks while trapping and tagging crows. Years later, those same crows would dive-bomb anyone wearing that specific mask—even though they'd never been trapped by that person."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
POV shot from a person wearing a distinctive mask walking through a park. Multiple crows suddenly dive-bomb from above in slow motion, wings spread, cawing aggressively. Dramatic Hitchcock-style cinematography, tense music implied, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Attack sequence, dramatic tension

---

## Scene 4: Point 2 (15 seconds)
**Script:** "Even more disturbing: crows teach their offspring to hate the same people. Young crows who were never trapped themselves learned to attack the masked researchers just by watching their parents."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Split-screen shot: adult crow on a branch on the left, juvenile crow on the right, both watching a masked researcher below. The adult crows down to harass the person, the juvenile follows, mimicking the behavior. Educational, generational knowledge transfer visualized, 4K quality, 15 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Generational knowledge transmission

---

## Scene 5: Point 3 (10 seconds)
**Script:** "This means crows have cultural memory. They pass down knowledge of threats across generations, creating vendetta lineages that can last decades."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Animated family tree visualization superimposed over footage of crows. Lines connecting adult crows to juveniles, spreading knowledge like a neural network. Dark, mysterious atmosphere with glowing connection lines, scientific documentary aesthetic, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Knowledge network, cultural transmission

---

## Scene 6: Conclusion (5 seconds)
**Script:** "So if you've ever wronged a crow, its grandchildren are plotting revenge right now."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Slow zoom into a murder of crows perched on power lines silhouetted against a stormy sky, all staring in the same direction (toward camera). Ominous, thriller-style ending, 4K quality, 5 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Ominous collective threat
