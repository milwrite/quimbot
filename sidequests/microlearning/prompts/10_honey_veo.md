# Veo Prompts: Honey Never Spoils

**Video Title:** Honey Never Spoils  
**Total Scenes:** 6 + branded outro  
**Estimated Veo Cost:** $3.60 (6 scenes × $0.60)

## Scene 1: Hook (3 seconds)
**Script:** "This food is three thousand years old, and you could still eat it for breakfast."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Extreme slow-motion pour of golden honey from ancient clay jar, light refracting through the viscous liquid creating amber glow. Mesmerizing, hypnotic motion, dramatic side lighting, 4K quality, 3 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Honey's beauty and timelessness

---

## Scene 2: Setup (12 seconds)
**Script:** "Archaeologists excavating ancient Egyptian tombs discovered jars of honey sealed thousands of years ago. When they opened them, the honey was still perfectly preserved—golden, sweet, and edible."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Cinematic shot inside an Egyptian tomb, dusty sunbeams cutting through darkness. Archaeologist carefully lifting sealed clay honey jar from stone shelf, brushing away dust. Dramatic lighting, sense of discovery, Indiana Jones aesthetic, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Archaeological discovery moment

---

## Scene 3: Point 1 (12 seconds)
**Script:** "Honey never spoils because of its unique chemistry. It's extremely low in moisture and highly acidic, creating an environment where bacteria and microorganisms simply can't survive."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Stylized scientific visualization: microscopic view of honey's molecular structure, water molecules being expelled. Bacteria attempting to enter but being repelled by acidic environment. Educational CGI with amber/golden color palette, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Scientific explanation visualized

---

## Scene 4: Point 2 (15 seconds)
**Script:** "When bees make honey, they add an enzyme that produces hydrogen peroxide, a natural antimicrobial agent. The thick consistency also prevents oxygen from penetrating, stopping decomposition."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Close-up macro shot of honeybee depositing honey into honeycomb cell. Transition to CGI overlay showing enzyme action creating protective compounds. Bubbles of oxygen being blocked by viscous honey layer. Nature documentary meets molecular biology, 4K quality, 15 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Bee creation process + chemical protection

---

## Scene 5: Point 3 (10 seconds)
**Script:** "As long as it's sealed properly, honey can last indefinitely. The oldest known honey sample is over five thousand years old from the country of Georgia, still intact."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Time-lapse comparison: left side shows fruit rotting, bread molding, milk spoiling (rapid decay). Right side shows honey jar remaining pristine and unchanged over identical time period. Stark preservation contrast, educational demonstration, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Preservation comparison, honey's uniqueness

---

## Scene 6: Conclusion (5 seconds)
**Script:** "Honey is one of the few foods that's genuinely immortal."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Elegant shot of modern glass jar of honey on marble surface next to ancient Egyptian clay jar, both containing identical golden honey. Sunlight streaming through both, showing no difference. Timeless beauty, philosophical reflection, 4K quality, 5 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Ancient and modern united, timelessness

---

## Scene 7: CTA (3 seconds)
**Format:** Branded outro card (not Veo-generated)

**Design:**
- Text: "Follow for more food science"
- Background: Honeycomb pattern with golden honey dripping
- Logo: Channel branding
