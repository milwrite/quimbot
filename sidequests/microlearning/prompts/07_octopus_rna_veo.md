# Veo Prompts: Octopuses Edit Their Own RNA

**Video Title:** Octopuses Edit Their Own RNA  
**Total Scenes:** 6 + branded outro  
**Estimated Veo Cost:** $3.60 (6 scenes × $0.60)

---

## Scene 1: Hook (3 seconds)
**Script:** "Octopuses can rewrite their own genetic code in real time. Humans can't do this."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Close-up of octopus skin changing colors and patterns in rapid succession, rippling across its body. Hypnotic, alien beauty. Underwater lighting with bioluminescent glow, otherworldly atmosphere, 4K quality, 3 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Shape-shifting ability as metaphor

---

## Scene 2: Setup (12 seconds)
**Script:** "Most animals, including us, are locked into the DNA we're born with. But octopuses have a superpower: they can edit their RNA, the messenger molecule that translates DNA into proteins."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Underwater shot of octopus gracefully swimming through kelp forest, tentacles flowing. Overlay: stylized CGI visualization of DNA double helix transitioning to RNA strand. Scientific documentary aesthetic blended with natural footage, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Natural beauty meets molecular science

---

## Scene 3: Point 1 (12 seconds)
**Script:** "This means they can adapt to changing environments almost instantly. Moving from warm water to cold? An octopus can edit its nerve cell proteins on the fly to maintain function."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Split-screen visualization: octopus swimming through warm tropical reef (left) transitions seamlessly to cold deep-sea environment (right). Its body adapts in real time—color change, texture shift. CGI overlay shows RNA editing process at cellular level, glowing molecular changes, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Environmental adaptation visualized

---

## Scene 4: Point 2 (15 seconds)
**Script:** "Scientists discovered that octopuses edit their RNA at rates tens of thousands of times higher than humans. They're constantly rewriting their biology to suit their needs."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Stylized CGI sequence: RNA strand unraveling, individual nucleotide letters swapping positions rapidly. Cut to octopus neurons firing with activity, neural network visualization pulsing with edits. Futuristic sci-fi aesthetic, glowing molecular structures, 4K quality, 15 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Molecular editing process—rapid transformation

---

## Scene 5: Point 3 (10 seconds)
**Script:** "The tradeoff? This ability comes at a cost. Octopuses have sacrificed traditional DNA evolution, which is why they haven't changed much in millions of years."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Time-lapse visualization: ancient fossilized octopus transitioning to modern octopus, showing minimal morphological change. Timeline scrolls in background (millions of years). Melancholic, reflective mood, educational documentary style, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Evolutionary stasis—tradeoff revealed

---

## Scene 6: Conclusion (5 seconds)
**Script:** "They chose adaptation over evolution—a fundamentally alien approach to survival."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Slow-motion shot of octopus camouflaging perfectly against coral reef, becoming nearly invisible. Final reveal as it uncloaks slightly, one eye visible staring at camera. Alien intelligence implied, mysterious ending, 4K quality, 5 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Alien intelligence, perfect camouflage

---

## Scene 7: CTA (3 seconds)
**Format:** Branded outro card (not Veo-generated)

**Design:**
- Text: "Follow for more alien science"
- Background: Octopus tentacle with molecular structure overlay
- Logo: Channel branding
