**Video Title:** Tardigrades Can Survive Anything  
**Total Scenes:** 6 + branded outro  
**Estimated Veo Cost:** $3.60 (6 scenes × $0.60)

---

## Scene 1: Hook (3 seconds)
**Script:** "This creature can survive in outer space, endure extreme radiation, and come back from the dead. It's smaller than a grain of sand."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Extreme macro close-up of a tardigrade under a microscope, translucent body with eight legs crawling slowly. Alien-like appearance, slightly cute but otherworldly. Scientific blue-tinted lighting, crystalline background, 4K quality, 3 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Alien yet adorable microscopic creature

---

## Scene 2: Setup (12 seconds)
**Script:** "Meet the tardigrade, also called a water bear. This microscopic animal is the toughest living thing on Earth, and possibly the entire universe."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Slow zoom into a water droplet on a moss-covered rock. Inside the droplet, a tardigrade moves gracefully. Transition to stylized CGI enhancement showing the tardigrade in vivid detail. Sci-fi documentary aesthetic, glowing edges, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Scale revelation—microscopic world made visible

---

## Scene 3: Point 1 (12 seconds)
**Script:** "Tardigrades can survive temperatures from near absolute zero to over three hundred degrees Fahrenheit. They've been frozen for thirty years, thawed out, and walked away like nothing happened."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Split-screen visualization: left side shows tardigrade frozen in ice, crystalline patterns forming. Right side shows tardigrade in extreme heat, glowing red environment. Center: tardigrade walking normally through both conditions, unaffected. Sci-fi CGI style, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Extreme temperature resilience

---

## Scene 4: Point 2 (15 seconds)
**Script:** "They can withstand radiation levels a thousand times higher than humans. In 2007, scientists sent them to space. Exposed to the vacuum and cosmic rays, most survived and even reproduced afterward."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
CGI shot of a tardigrade floating in outer space, Earth visible in the background. Stars and cosmic rays pass through the frame. The tardigrade tumbles slowly, backlit by the sun, peaceful and serene despite the hostile environment. Cinematic space documentary style, 4K quality, 15 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Tardigrade in space—surreal scale contrast

---

## Scene 5: Point 3 (10 seconds)
**Script:** "How? They enter a state called cryptobiosis, essentially shutting down all metabolic processes and becoming nearly indestructible."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Animated CGI sequence showing tardigrade's body transforming: water molecules evaporating, body curling into a protective "tun" state, glowing protective shield forming around it. Scientific visualization style with molecular detail, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Biological transformation process

---

## Scene 6: Conclusion (5 seconds)
**Script:** "When Earth is gone, tardigrades will likely still be here, waiting for the next planet."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Dramatic zoom out from a tardigrade on a barren, post-apocalyptic Earth landscape to a view of the planet from space. Tardigrade remains visible as a tiny speck. Epic, melancholic sci-fi mood, 4K quality, 5 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Cosmic perspective, ultimate survivor

---

## Scene 7: CTA (3 seconds)
**Format:** Branded outro card (not Veo-generated)

**Design:**
- Text: "Follow for more bizarre science"
- Background: Microscope view aesthetic with tardigrade silhouette
- Logo: Channel branding
