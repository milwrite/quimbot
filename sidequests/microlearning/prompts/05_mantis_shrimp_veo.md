# Veo Prompts: Mantis Shrimp Vision

**Video Title:** Mantis Shrimp Vision  
**Total Scenes:** 6 + branded outro  
**Estimated Veo Cost:** $3.60 (6 scenes × $0.60)

---

## Scene 1: Hook (3 seconds)
**Script:** "This shrimp can see colors you can't even imagine. But it's terrible at telling them apart."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Extreme close-up of a mantis shrimp's compound eye, rainbow iridescent colors reflecting off the surface. The eye is alien, beautiful, and hypnotic. Underwater lighting with sun rays filtering through water, 4K quality, 3 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Alien eye structure, visual beauty

---

## Scene 2: Setup (12 seconds)
**Script:** "The mantis shrimp has sixteen color receptors in its eyes. Humans have only three. You'd think that means they see way more colors than we do, right? Wrong."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Underwater tracking shot of a vibrant peacock mantis shrimp on a coral reef, vivid greens, blues, and oranges. Slow motion as it moves its eyes independently, scanning the environment. Colorful coral and tropical fish in background, crystal clear water, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Mantis shrimp in its natural habitat, vivid colors

---

## Scene 3: Point 1 (12 seconds)
**Script:** "Scientists tested them and discovered mantis shrimp are actually worse at distinguishing between similar colors than we are. They can detect more wavelengths but can't process the subtle differences."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Split-screen visualization: left side shows a color spectrum explosion into 16 distinct bands (mantis shrimp vision). Right side shows subtle gradient blending (human color processing). Stylized scientific diagram with animated color transitions, educational documentary aesthetic, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Vision comparison—data visualization

---

## Scene 4: Point 2 (15 seconds)
**Script:** "So why have sixteen receptors? Speed. Instead of blending colors like our brains do, mantis shrimp recognize colors instantly without processing. They sacrifice precision for reaction time."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Underwater slow-motion shot of mantis shrimp's eyes rapidly scanning environment, locking onto a small fish. Stylized "target lock" visual effect overlays the prey. Fast cuts between normal speed (instant recognition) and slow motion (showing the speed), 4K quality, 15 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Speed and hunting focus mechanism

---

## Scene 5: Point 3 (10 seconds)
**Script:** "This makes sense when you realize they're ambush predators with the fastest punch in the animal kingdom. They need to identify prey and strike in milliseconds."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Ultra-slow-motion shot of a mantis shrimp striking at prey with its club-like appendage. Shockwave visible in the water from the impact. Dramatic, explosive motion captured at 1000fps equivalent. Underwater cinematography, incredible detail, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Signature strike—power and speed

---

## Scene 6: Conclusion (5 seconds)
**Script:** "More sensors doesn't always mean better vision—it means different priorities."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Close-up of mantis shrimp resting in its burrow, eyes still alert and scanning. Peaceful underwater scene with gentle water movement, sunlight filtering down. Reflective, calm mood, 4K quality, 5 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Peaceful conclusion, reflection

---

## Scene 7: CTA (3 seconds)
**Format:** Branded outro card (not Veo-generated)

**Design:**
- Text: "Follow for more ocean mysteries"
- Background: Underwater coral reef with mantis shrimp silhouette
- Logo: Channel branding
