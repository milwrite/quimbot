**Veo Prompt:**
```

## Scene 2: Setup (12 seconds)
**Script:** "After World War One, Australian veterans were given farmland in Western Australia. But there was a problem: emus. Tens of thousands of them were destroying crops, and farmers were desperate."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Tracking shot across wheat fields in the Australian outback. Close-up of crops being trampled and destroyed by emus. Farmers in 1930s clothing looking distressed, gesturing at the destruction. Golden hour lighting, dust in the air, vintage newsreel aesthetic, 4K quality, 12 seconds.
```

## Scene 3: Point 1 (10 seconds)

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Dramatic shot of Australian soldiers in 1930s military uniforms setting up a Lewis machine gun on a tripod. Emus visible in the distance, running across the landscape. Soldiers aiming with serious expressions, absurd juxtaposition. Sepia-toned vintage war footage style, 4K quality, 10 seconds.
```

**Visual Focus:** Military vs. birds—comedic contrast

## Scene 4: Point 2 (15 seconds)
**Script:** "The emus were faster, smarter, and more tactical than anyone expected. They scattered into small groups, making them impossible to target. After weeks of failed attempts and wasted ammunition, the military withdrew in humiliation."

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Aerial view of emus scattering in multiple directions as soldiers fire. Slow-motion shots of emus zigzagging and evading. Cut to bewildered soldiers lowering their weapons, looking defeated. Empty bullet casings on the ground. Comedic, cinematic timing, vintage film quality, 4K, 15 seconds.
```

```
